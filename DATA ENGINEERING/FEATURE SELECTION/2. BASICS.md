# Basic Feature Selection Methods

Feature selection is a crucial step in machine learning to remove irrelevant, redundant, or uninformative features from a dataset. Basic methods focus on detecting and eliminating features that provide little to no value for model performance. These methods include **constant features, quasi-constant features, and duplicated features**.

---

## **1. Constant Features**
Constant features are those that have the same value across all observations in a dataset. Since they do not provide any variability, they do not contribute to predictive modeling.

### **How to Identify Constant Features:**
- Compute the variance of each feature.
- Drop features with zero variance.

### **Example:**
| Feature A | Feature B | Feature C |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 10        | 3.14      | 0         |
| 10        | 2.71      | 0         |
| 10        | 1.62      | 0         |

- **Feature A** has a constant value (10) and should be removed.
- **Feature C** has a constant value (0) and is also irrelevant.

### **Why Remove Constant Features?**
✅ Reduce dataset size and computational cost.  
✅ Improve model efficiency without losing predictive information.  
✅ Prevent unnecessary complexity in machine learning models.

---

## **2. Quasi-Constant Features**
Quasi-constant features take only one value for the vast majority of observations but may have minor variations. These features have very low variance and do not significantly contribute to model performance.

### **How to Identify Quasi-Constant Features:**
- Set a threshold (e.g., 99% of values being the same).
- Drop features where the dominant value appears more than the defined threshold.

### **Example:**
| Feature X | Feature Y | Feature Z |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 5         | 100       |
| 1         | 5         | 100       |
| 1         | 5         | 101       |
| 1         | 5         | 100       |
| 1         | 5         | 100       |

- **Feature X** and **Feature Y** are quasi-constant because they have the same value in almost all rows.

### **Why Remove Quasi-Constant Features?**
✅ Improve model generalization by focusing on meaningful variations.  
✅ Reduce overfitting by removing features with negligible contribution.  
✅ Enhance dataset interpretability.

---

## **3. Duplicated Features**
Duplicated features contain identical information and add redundancy to the dataset. These may arise due to preprocessing techniques like **one-hot encoding** of categorical variables.

### **How to Identify Duplicated Features:**
- Compute the correlation matrix to find features with a correlation of 1.
- Identify duplicate columns by comparing feature values directly.

### **Example of One-Hot Encoding Creating Duplicated Features:**
| Color_Red | Color_Blue | Color_Green |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1         | 0         | 0          |
| 0         | 1         | 0          |
| 0         | 0         | 1          |

- If only two categories exist (e.g., **Red** and **Blue**), one feature can be removed since it is completely determined by the others.

### **Why Remove Duplicated Features?**
✅ Avoid multicollinearity, which can affect model performance.  
✅ Reduce dimensionality and training time.  
✅ Improve model interpretability by removing redundant information.

---

## **Conclusion**
Basic feature selection techniques help streamline datasets by removing constant, quasi-constant, and duplicated features. These methods reduce computational overhead, prevent redundant information, and enhance model efficiency without sacrificing predictive power. By applying these techniques early in the preprocessing stage, one can significantly improve model robustness and interpretability.

<a id= 'constant'></a>
# Constant Features in Feature Selection

Constant features are features in a dataset that have the same value across all observations. These features do not provide any variability, making them uninformative for predictive modeling. Removing constant features helps streamline the dataset, reduce computational overhead, and prevent unnecessary complexity in machine learning models.

## **Characteristics of Constant Features**
- Have the same value in all rows of the dataset.
- Provide no useful information for model training.
- Increase data dimensionality without adding predictive power.
- Can be detected using simple statistical techniques like variance computation.

---

## **Why Remove Constant Features?**
✅ **Reduce Dataset Size**: Eliminating constant features decreases memory usage and speeds up model training.  
✅ **Improve Model Efficiency**: A smaller feature space improves model performance without losing relevant information.  
✅ **Enhance Interpretability**: Redundant features add unnecessary complexity, making models harder to interpret.  
✅ **Prevent Overfitting**: Irrelevant features can introduce noise, leading to overfitting in some cases.

---

## **Example of Constant Features**
| Feature A | Feature B | Feature C |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 10        | 3.14      | 0         |
| 10        | 2.71      | 0         |
| 10        | 1.62      | 0         |

- **Feature A** has the same value (10) in all rows → should be removed.
- **Feature C** has the same value (0) in all rows → should be removed.

---

## **How to Detect Constant Features?**
There are several approaches to identifying constant features:

### **1. Variance Threshold Method**
- Compute the variance of each feature.
- Drop features with a variance of **zero**.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold

selector = VarianceThreshold(threshold=0)  # Removes features with zero variance
X_reduced = selector.fit_transform(X)
```

### **2. Unique Value Count Method**
- Count the number of unique values per feature.
- Drop features with only **one unique value**.

```python
constant_features = [col for col in X.columns if X[col].nunique() == 1]
X_reduced = X.drop(columns=constant_features)
```

---

## **Common Causes of Constant Features**
- **Data Collection Issues**: Some sensors or survey questions may record the same value for all observations.
- **Feature Engineering Errors**: Created features may inadvertently hold a constant value.
- **Poorly Encoded Categorical Variables**: Some categorical variables may map to a single constant numerical representation.
- **One-Hot Encoding Artifacts**: If a category is never present in the dataset, its one-hot encoded column remains constant.

---

## **Conclusion**
Constant features add no value to machine learning models and should be removed during preprocessing. Identifying and eliminating them enhances model efficiency, reduces overfitting risks, and improves overall dataset quality. Simple variance thresholding or unique value counts are effective methods to detect and eliminate these features.

<a id= 'quasi'></a>
# Quasi-Constant Features in Feature Selection

Quasi-constant features are features that have the same value for the vast majority of observations in a dataset but may have minor variations. These features exhibit very low variance and often do not contribute significantly to predictive modeling. Detecting and removing quasi-constant features helps in reducing data dimensionality, improving model efficiency, and preventing noise from affecting the learning process.

## **Characteristics of Quasi-Constant Features**
- Have one dominant value that appears in the majority of rows (e.g., more than 99% of the time).
- Provide very little variability in the dataset.
- Can negatively impact model generalization by introducing redundant or uninformative features.
- Are often the result of data collection errors, default settings, or rare occurrences in categorical variables.

---

## **Why Remove Quasi-Constant Features?**
✅ **Reduce Computational Complexity**: Removing unnecessary features decreases processing time and memory usage.  
✅ **Improve Model Performance**: Eliminating low-variance features enhances the generalization ability of machine learning models.  
✅ **Avoid Overfitting**: Quasi-constant features may introduce noise that prevents the model from learning effectively.  
✅ **Enhance Interpretability**: A cleaner dataset helps in better understanding the key drivers of model predictions.

---

## **Example of Quasi-Constant Features**
| Feature X | Feature Y | Feature Z |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 5         | 100       |
| 1         | 5         | 100       |
| 1         | 5         | 101       |
| 1         | 5         | 100       |
| 1         | 5         | 100       |

- **Feature X** and **Feature Y** are quasi-constant because they have the same value in more than 95% of the rows.
- **Feature Z** varies slightly but is still dominated by a single value (100).

---

## **How to Detect Quasi-Constant Features?**
There are multiple ways to identify quasi-constant features:

### **1. Frequency Threshold Method**
- Identify features where one value appears in more than a predefined percentage (e.g., 99%) of observations.

```python
import pandas as pd

threshold = 0.99  # 99% of the values are the same
quasi_constant_features = [col for col in X.columns if X[col].value_counts(normalize=True).values[0] > threshold]
X_reduced = X.drop(columns=quasi_constant_features)
```

### **2. Variance Threshold Method**
- Use **VarianceThreshold** from Scikit-Learn to drop features with very low variance.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold

selector = VarianceThreshold(threshold=0.01)  # Removes features with variance lower than 0.01
X_reduced = selector.fit_transform(X)
```

---

## **Common Causes of Quasi-Constant Features**
- **Data Collection Errors**: Some sensors or surveys record nearly the same value across all observations.
- **Default Settings**: Some variables may take a default value that rarely changes.
- **Poor Feature Engineering**: New features created during preprocessing might contain dominant values.
- **Rare Categories in Categorical Data**: When one category appears overwhelmingly more than others.

---

## **Conclusion**
Quasi-constant features do not add meaningful variability to a dataset and can be safely removed to improve computational efficiency and model performance. Detecting them using frequency thresholds or variance-based methods helps in building more robust machine learning models.

<a id= 'duplicated'></a>
# Duplicated Features in Feature Selection

Duplicated features are columns in a dataset that contain identical values across all observations. These features do not contribute additional information to a model and should be removed to reduce redundancy, improve computational efficiency, and prevent potential multicollinearity issues.

## **Characteristics of Duplicated Features**
- Have identical values across all rows.
- Do not provide new information beyond what is already present in other features.
- Often arise due to preprocessing techniques like one-hot encoding or feature engineering errors.
- Can lead to overfitting and increased model complexity if not removed.

---

## **Why Remove Duplicated Features?**
✅ **Reduce Dataset Size**: Eliminating redundant features decreases memory usage and speeds up computations.  
✅ **Improve Model Performance**: Fewer, more informative features lead to better generalization.  
✅ **Avoid Multicollinearity**: Redundant features can introduce dependencies that affect model interpretability.  
✅ **Enhance Feature Selection**: Keeping only unique features simplifies data preprocessing and model tuning.

---

## **Example of Duplicated Features**
| Feature A | Feature B | Feature C |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 10        | 20        | 10        |
| 15        | 25        | 15        |
| 12        | 22        | 12        |

- **Feature A** and **Feature C** are identical, making **Feature C** redundant.
- Removing **Feature C** retains all necessary information while reducing dataset size.

---

## **How to Detect Duplicated Features?**
There are multiple ways to identify duplicated features:

### **1. Direct Column Comparison Method**
- Compare each feature column with every other column to find duplicates.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Identify duplicated columns
duplicated_features = X.T.duplicated()
X_reduced = X.loc[:, ~duplicated_features]
```

### **2. Correlation-Based Method**
- Compute the correlation matrix and remove highly correlated features (correlation = 1).

```python
corr_matrix = X.corr().abs()
upper_triangle = corr_matrix.where(~np.tril(np.ones(corr_matrix.shape), k=0).astype(bool))
duplicated_features = [column for column in upper_triangle.columns if any(upper_triangle[column] == 1.0)]
X_reduced = X.drop(columns=duplicated_features)
```

### **3. Hashing Method for Large Datasets**
- Convert feature columns into hash values and check for duplicates.

```python
import hashlib

def hash_column(series):
    return hashlib.md5(str(series.values).encode()).hexdigest()

hashed_features = X.apply(hash_column)
duplicated_features = hashed_features.duplicated()
X_reduced = X.loc[:, ~duplicated_features]
```

---

## **Common Causes of Duplicated Features**
- **One-Hot Encoding Artifacts**: Encoding categorical variables can create redundant binary features.
- **Data Preprocessing Errors**: Merging datasets or transformations can accidentally duplicate columns.
- **Feature Engineering Issues**: New features derived from existing ones may sometimes be identical.
- **Data Entry or Collection Errors**: Repeated measurements or logging issues may create duplicate variables.

---

## **Conclusion**
Duplicated features add redundancy to a dataset, increasing model complexity without improving predictive power. Identifying and removing them helps in optimizing data preprocessing, reducing storage needs, and improving model efficiency. Using direct comparison, correlation analysis, or hashing techniques ensures effective detection of duplicated features.
