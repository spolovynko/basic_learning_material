| **Metric**                | **What it Calculates**                                                                 | **When to Use**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.                    | When all errors are treated equally, and simplicity or interpretability is important.              |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** | Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.                      | When penalizing larger errors more heavily is critical (e.g., in sensitive applications).           |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** | Square root of MSE, giving error in the same unit as the target variable.                | When you want error magnitude in the same scale as the data, and large errors are a concern.        |
| **R-Squared (R²)**         | Proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.                    | When evaluating overall fit of the model and how well it explains the variability in the data.      |
| **Adjusted R-Squared**     | R² adjusted for the number of features in the model to penalize overfitting.             | When comparing models with different numbers of features.                                           |
| **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** | Average percentage difference between predicted and actual values.                      | When the target variable varies significantly in scale and percentage error is more interpretable.  |
| **Explained Variance**     | Proportion of variance in the target variable captured by the model.                     | Similar to R², use to evaluate goodness of fit.                                                    |
| **Huber Loss**             | Combines MAE and MSE; treats small errors like MSE and large errors like MAE.            | When working with data containing outliers, balancing robustness and sensitivity.                  |
| **Log-Cosh Loss**          | Smooth loss function similar to MAE, but less sensitive to outliers.                     | When robustness to outliers is needed without extreme penalty on larger deviations.                |
| **Quantile Loss**          | Evaluates performance based on a specific quantile of the target distribution.           | When focusing on prediction intervals or specific parts of the target distribution (e.g., extremes).|
