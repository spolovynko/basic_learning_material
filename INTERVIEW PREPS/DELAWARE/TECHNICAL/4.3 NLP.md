# **1) What are the main challenges in Natural Language Processing (NLP)?**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Despite major advances, NLP remains a difficult problem due to the **inherent complexity and richness of human language**. Below are the key challenges in NLP and why they matter.

---

### **1. Ambiguity**

Language is full of ambiguities that require human-level intelligence or extensive context to resolve.

#### **a. Lexical Ambiguity**

* Words with multiple meanings (polysemy).
* Example: "bank" can mean a financial institution or the side of a river.

#### **b. Syntactic Ambiguity**

* Multiple possible sentence structures.
* Example: "I saw the man with the telescope." (Who has the telescope?)

#### **c. Semantic Ambiguity**

* Multiple possible meanings for a phrase based on context.
* Example: "He promised to leave her alone." (Intentions are unclear.)

---

### **2. Contextual Understanding**

Language meaning often depends on **broader context** beyond a single sentence.

* **Coreference Resolution:** Understanding what pronouns or noun phrases refer to (e.g., "Anna gave Maria her book").
* **Discourse Relations:** Connecting ideas across multiple sentences or paragraphs.
* **Long-Range Dependencies:** Capturing connections and meaning spread over lengthy passages.

---

### **3. Resource Scarcity**

Developing high-performing NLP systems requires large, annotated datasets.

* **Low-Resource Languages:** Many languages lack digital corpora or labeled training data.
* **Domain-Specific Texts:** Specialized fields (e.g., legal, biomedical) require unique vocabularies and annotated corpora.

This limitation restricts the applicability of state-of-the-art models to only a few high-resource languages and domains.

---

### **4. Domain Adaptation**

Models trained on one domain often fail to generalize effectively to others.

* Example: A sentiment analysis model trained on movie reviews might perform poorly on financial news.
* Causes include vocabulary shifts, syntactic differences, and variations in writing style.

**Solutions:** Transfer learning, fine-tuning on domain-specific data, and domain-adaptive pretraining.

---

### **5. Multi-modality**

Many real-world applications involve **multiple data types**, such as text, images, video, or audio.

* Example: A virtual assistant interpreting spoken commands and displaying visual feedback.
* Challenge: Aligning and integrating linguistic data with other sensory inputs.

NLP must evolve to interact fluently with **multi-modal systems**, enabling more natural and human-like AI interactions.

---

### **Additional Challenges:**

* **Bias and Fairness:** NLP models often learn and replicate social biases present in training data.
* **Explainability:** Understanding and trusting NLP model outputs remains difficult, especially in deep models like transformers.
* **Data Privacy:** Text data often contains sensitive information that must be handled carefully.

---

### **Consultant Insight:**

As an AI consultant, addressing NLP challenges involves:

* Choosing models with strong contextual understanding (e.g., transformers, attention-based architectures)
* Balancing general models with domain-specific fine-tuning
* Educating clients about realistic capabilities and limitations of NLP systems

By recognizing and navigating these challenges, NLP applications can be developed that are more **accurate, ethical, and aligned with business goals.**


# **2) Explain the concept of word embeddings and how they are used in NLP**

**Word embeddings** are a foundational technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that represent words as **dense vectors in a continuous vector space**, capturing semantic relationships and contextual meaning more effectively than sparse representations like one-hot encoding.

---

### **Why Word Embeddings Matter:**

* Enable models to **understand semantic similarity** (e.g., "king" is close to "queen")
* Provide a **compact, information-rich representation** of language
* Improve **computational efficiency and generalization**

---

### **Types of Word Embeddings:**

#### **1. Static Word Embeddings**

These assign a single vector to each word, regardless of context.

##### **a. Word2Vec**

* Developed by Google
* Two architectures: **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)** and **Skip-Gram**
* Learns embeddings by predicting surrounding words or the current word from context

##### **b. GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)**

* Developed by Stanford
* Uses global co-occurrence statistics of words across a corpus
* Embeddings are learned by factorizing a word co-occurrence matrix

**Limitations:**

* Cannot distinguish between different meanings of the same word (e.g., "bat" as an animal vs. a baseball bat)

---

#### **2. Contextual Word Embeddings**

These generate **dynamic vectors** that depend on the surrounding context.

##### **a. ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)**

* Uses deep bi-directional LSTM to model context
* Produces different embeddings for the same word in different contexts

##### **b. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**

* Uses transformer architecture with bidirectional attention
* Provides deeply contextual embeddings for each word in a sentence

**Advantages:**

* Superior understanding of **polysemy, syntax, and semantics**
* Boost performance across a wide range of NLP tasks

---

### **Applications of Word Embeddings:**

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Identify sentiment-bearing terms and phrases
* **Machine Translation:** Map words across languages in shared embedding spaces
* **Question Answering and Search:** Match questions with relevant answers or documents
* **Clustering and Similarity:** Group semantically similar words or detect synonyms
* **Text Classification:** Serve as input features to deep learning models

---

### **How They Improve NLP Models:**

* Reduce dimensionality from high-dimensional sparse vectors
* Capture **semantic similarity** and **syntactic structure**
* Allow models to generalize better across vocabulary and language use

---

### **Consultant Insight:**

As an AI consultant, word embeddings allow you to:

* Build models that understand nuanced language use
* Recommend pretrained embeddings (e.g., BERT) or train custom ones for domain-specific needs
* Provide explainable insights into how models interpret language

In summary, word embeddings form the **bridge between raw text and deep learning** — enabling modern NLP systems to perform with intelligence, relevance, and adaptability.


# **3) How does the attention mechanism improve NLP tasks?**

The **attention mechanism** is a transformative concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling models to focus selectively on relevant parts of the input when performing a task. Originally introduced for **machine translation**, it is now central to **modern architectures** like the Transformer, BERT, and GPT.

---

### **Core Functionality of Attention**

* Attention computes **weights** that determine how much focus each word in the input sequence should receive relative to a given query.
* It allows the model to **dynamically adjust its focus** depending on the task and context.

#### **General Formula:**

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Where:

* **Q (Query), K (Key), V (Value):** Transformed representations of input tokens
* **$d_k$\*\*\*\*:** Dimensionality scaling factor
* **Softmax:** Converts scores into a probability distribution

---

### **Types of Attention**

#### **1. Self-Attention (Intra-Attention)**

* Each word in a sequence attends to all other words (including itself).
* Enables the model to **capture long-range dependencies**.

**Example:** In the sentence "The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired," self-attention helps the model understand that "it" refers to "the animal."

#### **2. Cross-Attention**

* Applied when there's an encoder-decoder setup (e.g., translation).
* Decoder queries the encoder outputs to selectively focus on relevant parts of the source sentence.

---

### **Advantages of the Attention Mechanism**

#### **1. Efficiently Captures Long-Term Dependencies**

* Unlike RNNs, which rely on sequential processing, attention allows **direct connections** between any two tokens.
* Greatly improves performance on long sequences.

#### **2. Enhances Interpretability**

* Attention weights can be **visualized** to understand what the model focuses on.
* Useful for **debugging**, **explaining decisions**, and identifying biases.

#### **3. Facilitates Parallelization**

* Especially in the Transformer model, attention mechanisms support **parallel computation**, speeding up training compared to sequential models like RNNs.

#### **4. Adaptability Across Tasks**

* Attention is **domain-agnostic** and is used in summarization, translation, question answering, sentiment analysis, and more.

---

### **Applications in NLP Tasks**

* **Machine Translation:** Dynamically aligns source and target words.
* **Text Summarization:** Focuses on the most informative parts of the text.
* **Question Answering:** Finds answer spans by attending to relevant context.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Improves recognition by focusing on surrounding context.

---

### **Consultant Insight**

As an AI consultant, understanding attention mechanisms enables you to:

* Justify the adoption of **Transformer-based models** (e.g., BERT, T5, GPT) for clients
* Interpret model predictions using **attention visualizations**
* Identify bottlenecks in older models and recommend **modern architectures** for better performance and scalability

Attention has redefined what's possible in NLP — it enables systems that are **context-aware, flexible, and highly accurate** across a wide array of language tasks.


# **4) What is the difference between RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs in NLP?**

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and their variants — **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** — are commonly used for modeling sequential data. Each architecture addresses different challenges, especially in capturing **temporal dependencies** and maintaining memory over time.

---

### **1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**

**Definition:**
RNNs are designed to process **sequential data** by maintaining a **hidden state** that carries information from previous time steps.

**How it works:**
At each time step, the RNN takes the current input and the previous hidden state to produce a new hidden state.

**Limitations:**

* **Vanishing gradients:** Gradients shrink as they are backpropagated through time, making it hard to learn long-term dependencies.
* **Exploding gradients:** In some cases, gradients can grow too large, destabilizing training.
* **Limited memory:** Standard RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies in text.

**Use Case:** Suitable for short sequences or tasks where temporal dependencies are limited.

---

### **2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**

**Definition:**
LSTM networks are an extension of RNNs designed to **retain information over longer sequences** using a sophisticated gating mechanism.

**Key Components:**

* **Memory cell:** Maintains internal state across time steps
* **Forget gate:** Decides what information to discard from the cell
* **Input gate:** Determines what new information to add
* **Output gate:** Controls what information to pass to the next layer

**Advantages:**

* Handles long-term dependencies effectively
* Reduces vanishing gradient issues

**Use Case:** Language modeling, machine translation, and other NLP tasks with **long sequences**

---

### **3. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**

**Definition:**
GRUs simplify LSTMs by combining gates to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining comparable performance.

**Key Components:**

* **Update gate:** Combines functions of input and forget gates
* **Reset gate:** Controls how much past information to forget

**Advantages:**

* Faster to train and more memory-efficient
* Often performs similarly to LSTMs with fewer computations

| Use in NLP         | Basic tasks | Complex, long-sequence tasks | Efficient sequence modeling |

---

### **Consultant Insight:**

As an AI consultant, the choice between RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs depends on:

* The **length and complexity** of the input sequences
* The **available computational resources**
* The **performance requirements** (accuracy vs. speed)

In modern NLP, **LSTMs and GRUs** are generally preferred over vanilla RNNs due to their superior handling of long-term dependencies and training stability. However, for many tasks, **transformer models** now surpass all three in terms of performance and scalability.

# **5) How does BERT differ from GPT?**

* Explain why BERT-based models excel in analysis, while GPT is ideal for creative and conversational applications
* Integrate and fine-tune models appropriately in client-facing NLP systems

In summary, **BERT understands language** and **GPT generates it** — together, they represent two complementary pillars of deep learning in NLP.


# **6) What is Named Entity Recognition (NER), and how is it implemented?**

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves **identifying and classifying key information** (entities) in text into predefined categories. Common entity types include **persons, organizations, locations, dates, times, monetary values**, and more.

NER plays a vital role in applications like **information extraction, search engines, content categorization, chatbots**, and **knowledge graph construction**.

---

### **Definition:**

NER is the process of:

1. **Detecting** entity mentions in text (e.g., "Barack Obama")
2. **Classifying** each detected mention into categories (e.g., PERSON, ORGANIZATION)

Example:
"Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in California."

* "Google" → ORGANIZATION
* "1998" → DATE
* "Larry Page" → PERSON
* "California" → LOCATION

---

### **Implementation Approaches:**

#### **1. Traditional Machine Learning Methods**

These use manually engineered features and probabilistic models.

* **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):** Use probabilistic sequences but limited in handling overlapping and long-range features.
* **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs):** More powerful than HMMs; model entire sequences to capture context better.

**Limitations:** Require significant feature engineering, less robust for diverse and noisy text.

---

#### **2. Deep Learning Methods**

These methods learn features automatically from data.

* **Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM):** Captures context from both directions in a sentence.
* **Bi-LSTM + CRF:** Combines the strengths of deep learning with CRFs for structured output.

**Advantages:** Improved generalization, better context understanding, less manual work.

---

#### **3. Transformer-Based Models**

Modern NER systems fine-tune **pretrained transformer models** on NER datasets.

* **BERT (and variants like RoBERTa, DistilBERT):**

  * Provide contextual embeddings
  * Fine-tuned using labeled corpora such as **CoNLL-2003**, **OntoNotes**, or **WNUT**

**Advantages:**

* **Domain Adaptation**: Generic models perform poorly in specialized domains (e.g., medical, legal)
* **Multilinguality**: Handling languages with different grammar and tokenization needs

---

### **Consultant Insight:**

As an AI consultant, you should:

* Recommend NER solutions based on the domain (off-the-shelf vs. custom models)
* Choose transformer models for high performance or general-purpose tasks
* Educate stakeholders on annotation needs and expected accuracy

NER transforms unstructured text into structured data — a critical step in **information extraction, automation, and decision support**.


# **7) How do Transformer models handle sequential data without RNNs?**

Transformer models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) by discarding the need for **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to handle sequential data. Instead, Transformers rely on a mechanism called **self-attention** and **positional encoding** to model sequence relationships and maintain context — all while enabling **parallel processing**.

---

### **Key Innovations Enabling Sequence Modeling Without RNNs**

#### **1. Self-Attention Mechanism**

* **Self-attention** allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in a sequence relative to every other word.
* For a given token, the model computes attention scores between it and all other tokens, capturing **contextual relationships** regardless of distance.

**Example:**
In the sentence "The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too big," self-attention helps disambiguate what "it" refers to by analyzing the entire sentence context.

**Benefits:**

* **Parallelism:** Unlike RNNs, self-attention doesn't rely on sequential processing, enabling faster training on modern hardware.
* **Global context:** Every token can attend to every other token, making it easier to model long-range dependencies.

---

#### **2. Positional Encoding**

* Since Transformers lack recurrence, they need an additional mechanism to understand the **order of tokens**.
* Positional encodings are added to token embeddings to inject information about **relative and absolute position**.

**Techniques:**

* **Sinusoidal Positional Encoding:** Fixed mathematical patterns based on position index
* **Learnable Position Embeddings:** Parameters learned during training

These embeddings allow the model to distinguish between "dog bites man" and "man bites dog."

---

### **Transformer Workflow for Sequential Data:**

1. **Tokenization and Embedding**: Text is split into tokens and mapped to vectors
2. **Add Positional Encoding**: Injects sequence order into input embeddings
3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Computes contextual relationships between tokens in parallel
4. **Feedforward Layers**: Further transform the attended representations
5. **Output Layer**: Generates predictions (e.g., next token, class label)

---

### **Advantages Over RNN-Based Models:**

| Feature                       | RNNs                            | Transformers                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Processing                    | Sequential                      | Fully parallel               |
| Long-Term Dependency Handling | Difficult (vanishing gradients) | Excellent (global attention) |
| Training Efficiency           | Slower                          | Fast and GPU-friendly        |
| Context Range                 | Limited by steps                | Unbounded per layer          |

---

### **Applications Enabled by Transformer Efficiency:**

* Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)
* Language modeling (e.g., GPT, BERT)
* Text summarization and question answering
* Speech and image sequence processing (via Vision Transformers)

---

### **Consultant Insight:**

As an AI consultant, understanding how Transformers model sequences is crucial when:

* Explaining performance improvements to stakeholders

* Comparing legacy systems with state-of-the-art solutions

Transformers marked a paradigm shift by showing that **recurrence isn't necessary for sequence modeling** — instead, intelligent design with attention and position-awareness can lead to superior results at scale.


# **8) What are the evaluation metrics for NLP models?**

Evaluating Natural Language Processing (NLP) models is crucial for understanding their performance and ensuring that they generalize well to real-world data. The choice of metrics depends on the **task type**, such as classification, generation, embedding quality, or language modeling.

---

### **1. Classification Tasks**

Used for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and topic classification.

#### **Common Metrics:**

* **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions (good for balanced datasets).
* **Precision:** True positives / (true positives + false positives); useful when **false positives are costly**.
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** True positives / (true positives + false negatives); important when **false negatives are costly**.
* **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall; balances both in a single score.
* **Macro, Micro, Weighted Averages:**

  * **Macro:** Equal weight for each class
  * **Micro:** Accounts for imbalance by aggregating total true positives, etc.

  * Useful for summarization.

* **METEOR:**

  * Considers synonyms, stemming, and word order.
  * Better correlation with human judgment than BLEU.

* **CHRF:**

  * Uses character n-gram F-scores; useful for morphologically rich languages.

#### **Human Evaluation Dimensions:**

* **Fluency:** Is the text grammatically and stylistically natural?
* **Adequacy:** Does it preserve the original meaning?
* **Coherence:** Is the text logically structured?
* **Diversity:** Is the model generating repetitive or varied outputs?

---

### **3. Language Modeling**

Evaluates how well a model predicts sequences of words.

#### **Perplexity:**

* Measures the model’s confidence in its predictions.

**Use Case:** Commonly used to evaluate autoregressive models (e.g., GPT, traditional LMs).

---

### **4. Embedding Evaluation**

Evaluates word or sentence embeddings used in semantic similarity and search.

#### **Intrinsic Evaluation:**

* **Cosine Similarity:** Measures similarity between two vectors.
* **Word Analogies:** Solves analogical problems (e.g., "man : king :: woman : ?")
* **Clustering Quality:** How well embeddings group semantically related words.

#### **Extrinsic Evaluation:**

* Performance of embeddings in downstream tasks (e.g., classification, QA).

---

### **5. Dialogue Systems and Conversational AI**

Involves open-ended responses where quality is hard to quantify.

#### **Metrics:**

* **BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE** (as proxies, though often insufficient)
* **BERTScore:** Uses contextual embeddings from BERT to compare similarity.
* **Dialog Evaluation Metrics:** e.g., **USL-H**, **ADEM**, or **ConvEval** for coherence, specificity, and informativeness.

#### **Human Metrics:**

* **Engagement**, **Relevance**, **Empathy**, and **Consistency**

---

### **Consultant Insight:**

When advising clients or designing solutions:

* Match metrics to the **business goal and task type**
* Use **multiple metrics** for robust evaluation
* Balance **automatic metrics** with **human evaluations**, especially in generative tasks

In summary, effective NLP evaluation requires a blend of **quantitative rigor and qualitative insight** — and choosing the right metrics is as important as building the model itself.


# **9) What is sentiment analysis, and what are its common approaches?**

**Sentiment analysis** (also known as opinion mining) is a popular NLP task that aims to **identify the emotional tone or polarity** (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in a piece of text. It is widely used to extract insights from **customer reviews, social media, surveys, and support tickets**.

---

Sentiment analysis turns unstructured text into **actionable emotional signals** — enabling smarter decision-making and enhanced customer understanding.


# **10) Explain the concept of transfer learning in NLP**

**Transfer learning** in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the **reuse of a model trained on one task or domain** (usually with abundant data) as the starting point for a new, often more specific task with less data. It allows models to leverage **learned language representations** from a general corpus and adapt them to **downstream tasks** like classification, summarization, or question answering.

---

### **Key Idea:**

Rather than training a model from scratch for each new NLP task, transfer learning enables the use of **pretrained models** that already understand grammar, syntax, and semantics — significantly **reducing the need for large task-specific datasets** and computational resources.

---

### **Phases of Transfer Learning:**

#### **1. Pretraining**

* The model learns general language representations from **large, diverse text corpora** (e.g., Wikipedia, Common Crawl).
* Common pretraining tasks:

  * **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** — BERT

# **11) What Is Syntactic Analysis?**

**Syntactic analysis**, also known as **syntax analysis** or **parsing**, is a fundamental component of natural language processing (NLP). It involves examining the grammatical structure of a sentence to understand how the words relate to each other in a syntactically correct way. Rather than focusing on the meaning of individual words, syntactic analysis seeks to uncover the **structural relationships** that govern how those words are combined.

---

### **1. Purpose of Syntactic Analysis**

The goal is to determine the **syntax tree** or **parse tree** of a sentence, which represents its hierarchical grammatical structure according to predefined rules of a formal grammar (such as context-free grammar).

#### **Examples:**

* Identifying subject-verb-object relationships.
* Detecting nested clauses or modifiers.
* Distinguishing parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).

---

### **2. How It Works**

#### **a. Tokenization**

Break the sentence into words or tokens.

#### **b. POS Tagging**

Assign each word a **Part-of-Speech (POS)** tag (e.g., noun, verb, preposition).

#### **c. Parsing Algorithms**

Apply parsing techniques such as:

* **Top-down parsing**
* **Bottom-up parsing**
* **Dependency parsing** (focuses on binary relationships between words)
* **Constituency parsing** (focuses on phrase structure)

---

### **3. Why It's Important**

Syntactic analysis enables deeper understanding of sentence structure, which is critical for:

* **Machine translation**
* **Text summarization**
* **Question answering systems**
* **Chatbots and virtual assistants**

It lays the groundwork for **semantic analysis**, which deals with understanding meaning.

---

### **4. Challenges in Syntactic Analysis**

* **Ambiguity**: A sentence can have multiple valid parse trees.
* **Complex grammar rules**: Natural languages have exceptions and irregularities.
* **Informal or ungrammatical inputs**: Parsing casual language or typos can be difficult.

---

### **Why This Matters for AI Consulting:**

As an AI consultant:

* Syntactic analysis helps in **designing NLP pipelines** that understand user queries or generate grammatically correct responses.
* It improves **model interpretability and accuracy** by uncovering linguistic structure.
* It supports tasks like **information extraction** and **semantic search** in enterprise applications.

---

In summary, syntactic analysis plays a critical role in enabling machines to understand how words fit together to form meaningful sentences, serving as a key layer between raw text and deeper language understanding.


# **12) What Are Stemming and Lemmatization?**

**Stemming** and **lemmatization** are key preprocessing techniques in **natural language processing (NLP)** used to reduce words to their base or root form. They are designed to **normalize** text by minimizing the number of distinct word forms in a corpus, thus improving **text analysis**, **information retrieval**, and **machine learning performance**.

---

### **1. What Is Stemming?**

Stemming is a heuristic process that removes suffixes or prefixes from a word to reach its **stem**, which may not be a valid word.

#### **Characteristics:**

* **Fast and rule-based.**
* May produce **non-dictionary root forms**.
* **Ignores context** and grammar.

#### **Example:**

* “Changing” → “Chang”
* “Running” → “Run”
* “Universities” → “Univers”

#### **Common Algorithms:**

* Porter Stemmer
* Snowball Stemmer
* Lancaster Stemmer

#### **Use Cases:**

* Search engines (e.g., reducing storage and query terms).
* Text classification tasks where speed matters more than precision.

---

### **2. What Is Lemmatization?**

Lemmatization transforms a word into its **lemma**, the proper dictionary root word, based on **context and part-of-speech (POS)**.

#### **Characteristics:**

* **Slower but more accurate.**
* Produces **valid words** that carry meaning.
* **Considers grammar rules and context.**

#### **Example:**

* “Changing” → “Change”
* “Was” → “Be”
* “Better” → “Good”

#### **Tools for Lemmatization:**

* WordNet Lemmatizer (via NLTK)
* spaCy Lemmatizer

#### **Use Cases:**

* Sentiment analysis
* Question answering systems
* Applications requiring precise linguistic understanding

### **3. Key Differences**

| Feature           | Stemming                           | Lemmatization                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Output            | May not be a real word             | Always a valid word           |
| Speed             | Faster                             | Slower                        |
| Context Awareness | No                                 | Yes                           |
| Use Case          | Large corpora, search optimization | High-quality NLP applications |
