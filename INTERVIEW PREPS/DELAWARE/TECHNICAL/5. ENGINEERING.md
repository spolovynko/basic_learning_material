## 2. üß† How to Implement a Neural Network from Scratch

Building a neural network from scratch is a valuable exercise that deepens your understanding of how deep learning works. It involves creating all components manually without relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

---

### üß± Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. **Define the Architecture**

* Decide the number of layers: input, hidden, and output.
* Choose the number of neurons in each layer.
* Example: A network for binary classification might have:

  * 1 input layer with `n` features
  * 1 hidden layer with 16 neurons
  * 1 output neuron with a Sigmoid activation

#### 2. **Initialize Parameters**

* **Weights:** Initialize using methods like:

  * **Random initialization** for basic setups
  * **He initialization** (for ReLU activation)
  * **Xavier initialization** (for Sigmoid or Tanh)
* **Biases:** Typically initialized to zeros

```python
weights = np.random.randn(n_input, n_hidden) * np.sqrt(2 / n_input)  # He init
biases = np.zeros((1, n_hidden))
```

---

#### 3. **Forward Propagation**

* Calculate the weighted sum for each neuron:

$z = W \cdot x + b$

* Apply activation functions to introduce non-linearity:

  * **ReLU:** $\text{max}(0, z)$
  * **Sigmoid:** $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$

* Repeat for each layer until you compute the final output

```python
z1 = np.dot(X, W1) + b1
a1 = np.maximum(0, z1)  # ReLU
z2 = np.dot(a1, W2) + b2
output = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z2))  # Sigmoid
```

---

#### 4. **Compute the Loss**

* Measure the difference between predicted and true output:

  * **Binary classification:** Binary cross-entropy
  * **Regression:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)

```python
loss = -np.mean(y * np.log(output) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - output))
```

---

#### 5. **Backward Propagation**

* Use the **chain rule** to compute gradients of the loss w\.r.t. weights and biases
* For each layer:

  * Compute derivatives of the loss
  * Backpropagate through activation functions
  * Accumulate gradient updates

```python
dz2 = output - y
dW2 = np.dot(a1.T, dz2)
db2 = np.sum(dz2, axis=0, keepdims=True)
```

---

#### 6. **Update Weights**

* Adjust parameters using gradient descent:

```python
W2 -= learning_rate * dW2
b2 -= learning_rate * db2
```

* Repeat for all layers

---

### üîÑ Loop the Process

Repeat forward + backward propagation for a number of **epochs**, using mini-batches if implementing **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**.

## 5.  What Is Transfer Learning and Why Is It Useful?

**Transfer learning** is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second, related task. It allows you to leverage pre-trained models to solve new problems more efficiently, especially when the new task has limited data.

---

### üß† How Transfer Learning Works

1. **Pretraining**

   * A model is trained on a large, generic dataset (e.g., ImageNet for images, Wikipedia for language).
   * It learns general features (e.g., edges, textures, sentence structure).

2. **Fine-tuning**

   * The pre-trained model is reused and slightly modified for the new task.
   * This usually involves freezing the earlier layers and retraining the final layers with the smaller, domain-specific dataset.
   * Optionally, the entire model can be fine-tuned if enough data is available.

---

### üìò Example: Transfer Learning in Practice

#### Scenario: Medical Image Classification

* **Challenge:** Limited labeled medical images for training a deep model from scratch.
