pip install transformers datasets seqeval scikit-learn pandas accelerate
```

---

## 🔁 **Step-by-Step Process**

### **1. Prepare Labeled Data (CoNLL Format)**

Your data must follow the BIO format:

```
The O
account O
ID B-ACCOUNT_ID
is O
X123-YYZ I-ACCOUNT_ID
. O
```

You can annotate this using manual tools or GUI tools like Label Studio or doccano. Save as `train.txt` and `validation.txt`.

---

### **2. Load and Preprocess the Data**

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("conll2003", data_files={
    "train": "train.txt",
    "validation": "validation.txt"
})
```

Define labels and tokenize inputs:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

label_list = ["O", "B-ACCOUNT_ID", "I-ACCOUNT_ID"]
label_to_id = {l: i for i, l in enumerate(label_list)}
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased")

def tokenize_and_align_labels(example):
    tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(example["tokens"], truncation=True, is_split_into_words=True)
    word_ids = tokenized_inputs.word_ids()
    labels = []
    prev_word_id = None
    for word_id in word_ids:
        if word_id is None:
            labels.append(-100)
        elif word_id != prev_word_id:
            labels.append(label_to_id[example["ner_tags"][word_id]])
        else:
            labels.append(label_to_id[example["ner_tags"][word_id]])
        prev_word_id = word_id
    tokenized_inputs["labels"] = labels
    return tokenized_inputs

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_and_align_labels, batched=True)
```

---

### **3. Load Pretrained Model for Token Classification**

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased", num_labels=len(label_list))
```

---

### **4. Set Up Trainer and Train**

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer, DataCollatorForTokenClassification

args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./ner_model",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=4,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["validation"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=DataCollatorForTokenClassification(tokenizer),
)

trainer.train()
```

---

### **5. Save the Model**

```python
trainer.save_model("ner-transformer-custom")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("ner-transformer-custom")
```

---

### **6. Run Inference**

```python
from transformers import pipeline
ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model="ner-transformer-custom", tokenizer="ner-transformer-custom", aggregation_strategy="simple")
results = ner_pipeline("The ACCOUNT_ID is X123-YYZ.")
print(results)
```

---

## 📦 **Next Step: Presidio Integration**

You can now wrap this custom model into a Presidio Recognizer to apply dynamic masking.

Would you like the next step for building a `CustomRecognizer` for Presidio from this model?


# **13) How to Train a Custom NER Model Using Ollama for Health and Religion Entity Detection**

To detect and mask sensitive content related to health and religion in documents, you can use a language model running locally via **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)**. Ollama allows you to run and fine-tune large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA or Mistral locally, enabling private and fast analysis.

---

## ✅ **Goal**

Use Ollama to run and fine-tune a language model that can extract health- and religion-related entities from text, then integrate it into a masking pipeline.

---

## 🛠️ **Tools Required**

| Tool                      | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Ollama`                  | Run and fine-tune local language models |
| `transformers` (optional) | Preprocess or evaluate externally       |
| `datasets`                | Load or structure labeled training data |
| `Pandas`                  | Preprocessing and formatting            |
| `LangChain` (optional)    | Manage prompt templates and chaining    |
| `Label Studio`, `Prodigy` | Data annotation tools                   |

---

## 🔁 **Step-by-Step Process**

### **1. Install and Set Up Ollama**

```bash
brew install ollama     # macOS
ollama run llama2       # Run a base model
```

Or use Docker for Linux/Windows. Check [Ollama installation guide](https://ollama.com/download).

---

### **2. Define Your Objective**

You are interested in extracting tokens/entities related to:

* `RELIGION`
* `HEALTH_CONDITION`
* `MEDICAL_TREATMENT`
* `SYMPTOM`

Define a schema or list of desired categories.

---

### **3. Prepare Labeled Data**

If you have custom documents:

* Use **Label Studio** to label sentences/tokens
* Format them in JSONL or CoNLL

Sample JSONL:

```json
{"text": "The patient has diabetes and follows a Muslim diet.", "entities": [{"start": 17, "end": 25, "label": "HEALTH_CONDITION"}, {"start": 41, "end": 47, "label": "RELIGION"}]}
```

---

### **4. Fine-Tune the Model with Ollama**

Create a `.modelfile`:

```
FROM llama2
PARAMETERS temperature=0.2
SYSTEM "You are a NER tagging assistant. Extract and tag health and religion terms in JSON."
```

Train the model:

```bash
ollama create ner-model -f ./Modelfile
```

Test inference:

```bash
ollama run ner-model
> The patient takes insulin and is a Christian.
```

Output expected:

```json
{"entities": [{"text": "insulin", "label": "MEDICAL_TREATMENT"}, {"text": "Christian", "label": "RELIGION"}]}
```

---

### **5. Evaluate and Improve**

* Validate accuracy using your test dataset.
* Fine-tune again with additional examples or augment training set.
* Use OpenAI eval framework or spaCy for validation.

---

### **6. Integrate into Python Workflow**

You can use Python to run a subprocess or HTTP server to interact with Ollama:

```python
import subprocess

def query_ollama(prompt):
    result = subprocess.run(["ollama", "run", "ner-model"], input=prompt.encode(), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    return result.stdout.decode()

response = query_ollama("The patient is a diabetic Buddhist.")
print(response)
```

Use this output to apply masking/redaction in your documents.

---

### **7. Optional: Use LangChain for Prompt Management**

If your use case involves chaining prompts or custom formatting:

```python
from langchain.llms import Ollama
llm = Ollama(model="ner-model")
response = llm("Tag health/religion terms in: 'He takes ibuprofen and prays five times daily.'")
```

---

## 🔐 **Security and Privacy**

Because Ollama runs models locally, **no data leaves your machine**, making it suitable for sensitive domains like healthcare or legal compliance.

---

## 📦 **Next Step: Presidio or Custom Redactor**

Once your model returns sensitive tokens, you can:

* Mask them directly in the text
* Wrap into a Presidio `Recognizer`
* Store JSON results for audit trails

Would you like a code example that integrates this directly into Presidio or builds a CLI app for batch processing?
