    "## How was the collaboration with development teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration with development teams went very well because I prioritize clear communication and a spirit of collaboration. During projects at ING, we worked within an Agile framework, with regular meetings to coordinate our efforts, such as daily stand-ups and retrospectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "I always make an effort to understand the developers' priorities and constraints to ensure my deliverables integrate effectively into their processes. For example, during the synthetic data generation project, I ensured that the results of statistical experiments and validations were well-documented and ready to be integrated into the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also adopt a proactive attitude to anticipate potential issues and facilitate discussions. In cases of technical disagreements, I encouraged a fact-based and collaborative approach to find the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, I value active listening, idea-sharing, and teamwork to ensure project success.\n"

    "## Were there any conflicts?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, conflicts can happen, especially in technical environments where approaches or priorities may differ. However, I see conflicts as an opportunity to improve communication and collaboration within the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, during a project at ING, there was a misunderstanding about the content of the metadata and the nature of synthetic data types. These types used a naming convention similar to SQL data types, but their meaning was different. This confusion led to errors in interpreting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, I initiated a discussion with the team to clarify the logic behind the synthetic data types and their specific use. I also created detailed documentation to align everyone’s understanding and prevent such issues from recurring in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, I always prioritize a constructive approach, where listening, respect, and objective analysis help turn conflicts into positive solutions for the project.\n"

    "\n",
    "In case of disagreement between developers, the best decision is one based on facts and objective data while aligning with the project's goals. It is essential to adopt a collaborative approach to analyze different perspectives and find the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, during a project at ING, there was a disagreement about the choice of algorithm for generating synthetic data. Some favored a copula-based model for its simplicity, while others preferred a deep learning model (CTGAN) for better accuracy. I suggested defining objective criteria, such as statistical performance, execution time, and ease of integration. We then tested both approaches using representative datasets and chose the solution that best met the project’s needs.\n",

    "In summary, I believe the best approach is to analyze the pros and cons of each option in a structured way and choose the one that delivers the most value to the project.\n"
