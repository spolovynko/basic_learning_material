    "# How Do You Ensure You Follow the SOLID Principles Daily?\n",
    "When asked this question in a technical interview, it's important to provide a structured and clear response, showcasing both your theoretical understanding and practical application of the SOLID principles. Here's a professional response:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Demonstrate Your Understanding of SOLID Principles\n",
    "Start by briefly explaining that SOLID principles are guidelines for designing maintainable, scalable, and robust software. Emphasize that adhering to these principles reduces bugs, simplifies testing, and makes it easier to adapt to changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Explain Your Daily Practices\n",
    "Discuss concrete steps you take in your daily work to ensure adherence to SOLID:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Planning and Designing\n",
    "\"Before writing code, I make sure I fully understand the functional and non-functional requirements. I then divide responsibilities to respect the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).\"\n",
    "\"I use tools like UML diagrams to visualize and validate my designs, ensuring they follow principles like DIP and ISP.\"\n",
    "#### b) Regular Refactoring\n",
    "\"I frequently review both my code and my teamâ€™s code to identify any violations of SOLID principles, such as classes with too many responsibilities or tightly coupled modules.\"\n",
    "\"I actively refactor code to separate responsibilities and decouple modules when needed.\"\n",
    "#### c) Testing and Validation\n",
    "\"I write unit tests to ensure that my classes behave as expected. For example, I test that subclasses can replace parent classes without breaking functionality (LSP).\"\n",
    "\"Tests also help me ensure that local changes don't inadvertently affect other parts of the system.\"\n",
    "## 3. Provide Practical Examples\n",
    "Illustrate your experience with examples from your projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "SRP:\n",
    "\"In a recent project, I refactored a class Order by extracting validation logic into a separate OrderValidator class. This separation made the Order class easier to maintain and extend.\"\n",
    "DIP:\n",
    "\"I used dependency injection to decouple a logging service. By defining an abstraction (ILogger) and injecting implementations (FileLogger, CloudLogger), I made it easy to switch or add logging mechanisms without changing existing code.\"\n",
    "## 4. Mention Tools and Best Practices\n",
    "\"I use frameworks and tools that promote SOLID principles, like dependency injection frameworks in Python or Java.\"\n",
    "\"Code reviews and linters also help me identify potential violations of these principles.\"\n",
    "## 5. Emphasize Balance and Pragmatism\n",
    "\"It's crucial to balance adherence to SOLID principles with practical constraints. For example, creating multiple interfaces to follow ISP might be overkill for a small or simple application. I always aim for pragmatic and scalable solutions.\"\n",
    "Sample Response for an Interview\n",
    "To ensure I adhere to the SOLID principles daily, I start by planning and defining responsibilities clearly (SRP). I apply dependency injection and abstractions to ensure my modules are decoupled (DIP), and I write unit tests to validate that my code respects contracts like substitutability (LSP). Regular code reviews and refactoring help me maintain code quality, and I always prioritize clarity and maintainability while avoiding unnecessary complexity. For example, in one project, I used the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) by implementing new payment methods through inheritance without modifying the core logic."
