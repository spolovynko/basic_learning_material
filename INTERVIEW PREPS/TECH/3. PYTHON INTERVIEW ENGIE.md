# What data structures do you use?

The choice of data structure depends on the problem to solve. I often use lists for ordered and flexible collections, dictionaries for fast lookups with unique keys, and sets for managing unique elements or performing comparisons. In specific cases, such as intensive numerical processing, I use Numpy or Pandas. My goal is always to choose the structure that best fits the nature of the data and the functional requirements."

# What is the difference between a list, a tuple, and an array?
- **List**: A mutable, ordered collection. You can add, remove, or modify elements.
- **Tuple**: An immutable, ordered collection. Once created, elements cannot be changed.
- **Array**: A fixed-type collection (via libraries like `array` or `numpy`) optimized for numerical operations and memory efficiency.


<a id='q3'></a>
# Keywords for
- **`break`**: Exits the loop prematurely.
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration.
- **`else`**: Executes after the loop ends if no `break` occurs.
- **`pass`**: Does nothing, used as a placeholder.

# Do you know about the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)? Is it a good or bad thing?

The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** is a mutex in CPython (the main implementation of Python) that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously.

#### Advantages:
- Simplifies memory management by avoiding race conditions in the CPython memory allocator.
- Ensures thread safety for single-threaded programs or those heavily dependent on I/O operations.

#### Disadvantages:
- Limits the performance of CPU-bound multi-threaded programs, as only one thread executes Python code at a time.
- Reduces Python's ability to leverage multi-core processors effectively for CPU-intensive tasks.

**Conclusion**: The GIL is a trade-off. It's good for simplicity and I/O-bound tasks but a bottleneck for CPU-bound multi-threaded applications.

# What is a virtual environment in Python? Why do we use virtual environments in Python?

### Answer

A **virtual environment** in Python is an isolated space for installing libraries and dependencies specific to a project, without affecting other projects or the global Python installation.

#### Why use a virtual environment?
1. **Isolation**: Keeps project dependencies separate to avoid conflicts.
2. **Version Management**: Allows specific package versions for each project.
3. **Easy Sharing**: A `requirements.txt` file helps replicate the environment.
4. **Cleanliness**: Keeps the global Python installation uncluttered.

#### Key Commands:
- Create: `python -m venv myenv`
- Activate: `source myenv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `myenv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Deactivate: `deactivate`

<a id='q6'></a>
# What is the difference between an iterator and a generator in Python?

### Answer

- **Iterator**:
  - An object with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods for traversing a collection.
  - Example: `iter([1, 2, 3])`.

- **Generator**:
  - A type of iterator created with a function using `yield`.
  - Produces values on demand without storing everything in memory.

#### Key Difference:
All generators are iterators, but not all iterators are generators. Generators are more efficient for on-the-fly data computation.

<a id='q7'></a>
# What is dependency injection (in backend development)?

### Answer

**Dependency Injection** is a design pattern where required dependencies (services, objects, or modules) are provided to a class or function instead of being created directly within it.

#### Advantages:
1. **Decoupling**: Reduces coupling between modules, making the code more flexible.
2. **Ease of Testing**: Allows replacing real dependencies with mocks or stubs for testing.
3. **Reusability**: Promotes modularity by enabling dependencies to be reused across different parts of the code.

#### Example in Python:
```python
class Database:
    def query(self):
        return "Data from database"

class Service:
    def __init__(self, db):
        self.db = db

    def get_data(self):
        return self.db.query()


# Dependency Injection
db_instance = Database()
service = Service(db_instance)
print(service.get_data())  # Output: Data from database
```
<a id='q8'></a>
# Have you worked with dependency injection tools in Python?

### Answer

Yes, I have worked with dependency injection tools in Python, particularly in the following contexts:

#### **Examples of Tools Used**:
- **Dependency Injector**: A library for explicit and organized dependency management in modular projects.
- **FastAPI**: Provides a built-in dependency injection system for creating modular and reusable REST APIs.

#### **Example with FastAPI**:
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

class Service:
    def get_data(self):
        return "Hello from the service!"

def get_service():
    return Service()

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root(service: Service = Depends(get_service)):
    return {"message": service.get_data()}
```

# What does asynchronous development mean to you? What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous?

### Answer

**Asynchronous development** allows tasks to be executed non-blocking, meaning a program can continue running while a long-running task (e.g., a network request) is in progress.

#### Differences between asynchronous and synchronous:

- **Synchronous**: Tasks are executed sequentially, and each task blocks execution until it finishes.
```python
def read_file():
    with open("file.txt") as f:
        return f.read()

print(read_file())  # The program waits for the file to be read before continuing.
```
- **Asynchronous** : Tasks are executed concurrently, allowing multiple tasks to run without blocking execution.
```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulates a long-running operation
    return "Data fetched!"

async def main():
    result = await fetch_data()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())  # The program continues during the "sleep".
```

- **Advantages of asynchronous development**:
Better performance for I/O-intensive tasks (e.g., HTTP requests or database access).
Improves application responsiveness.
- **Conclusion**: Asynchronous development is ideal for managing long or concurrent tasks without blocking the main program execution, making the system more efficient and responsive.

<a id='q10'></a>
# How is asynchronous development implemented in Python ("under the hood")?

### Answer

Asynchronous development in Python is implemented using several internal concepts and mechanisms to enable non-blocking execution:

#### **1. Event Loop**
- Managed by libraries like `asyncio`, the **event loop** is at the core of asynchronous execution.
- It schedules and runs coroutines, manages tasks, and handles events (e.g., I/O operations).
- Example:
```python
  import asyncio

  async def say_hello():
      await asyncio.sleep(1)
      print("Hello!")

  asyncio.run(say_hello())  # The event loop executes the coroutine.
``` 
#### **2. Coroutines**
Coroutines are functions defined with the async keyword that can be paused using await.
Python uses coroutines for lazy execution and efficient task management.
#### **3. await**
The await keyword pauses a coroutine until another task (like an I/O operation) is completed.
During this pause, control is returned to the event loop to run other tasks concurrently.
#### **4. Non-blocking I/O**
Python uses system-level libraries like select or epoll (on Linux) to monitor multiple sockets or files simultaneously without blocking execution.
#### **5. Futures and Tasks**
A Future represents a task that hasnâ€™t finished yet. In Python, tasks wrap coroutines to schedule their execution.
```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched!"

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())
    print(await task)

asyncio.run(main())  # The task is scheduled in the event loop.
```
#### **6. Multithreading and GIL**
Asynchronous programming in Python is single-threaded but cooperative. Tasks voluntarily release control using await, unlike traditional multithreading, which suffers from the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).
#### **Conclusion**:
 In Python, asynchronous development is implemented via an event loop, coroutines, and efficient non-blocking I/O management. This allows multiple tasks to run concurrently in a single thread using optimized system resources.

 # Do you know await and async? What are their uses and an example?

### Answer

`async` and `await` are used in Python for writing asynchronous code, enabling tasks to run without blocking the main program.

- **`async`**: Defines an asynchronous coroutine.
- **`await`**: Suspends the execution of a coroutine until an asynchronous task is completed.

#### **Example:**
```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Pause without blocking
    print("Hello!")

async def main():
    print("Starting...")
    await say_hello()
    print("Done!")

asyncio.run(main())  # Starts the event loop
```
Conclusion: async and await enable non-blocking development, useful for long-running tasks like network operations.

<a id='q12'></a>
# What is threading in Python?

### Answer

**Threading** allows multiple threads (lightweight subprocesses) to run in parallel. Itâ€™s useful for I/O-intensive tasks (network, file operations) and shares the memory of the main process.

#### Example:
```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Number: {i}")

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

**Limitation**:
The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) prevents threads from executing Python code simultaneously for CPU-intensive tasks.
**Conclusion**: Threading improves performance for I/O-bound tasks but is limited for CPU-intensive computations.


<a id='q13'></a>
# What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing in Python?

- **Multithreading**:
  - Multiple threads in the same process, sharing memory.
  - Limited by the GIL, inefficient for CPU-intensive tasks.
  - Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network, file operations).

```python
import threading

thread = threading.Thread(target=lambda: print("Thread running"))
thread.start()
thread.join()
```
- **Multiprocessing:**

  - Multiple independent processes, each with its own memory.
  - Utilizes multiple CPU cores, ideal for CPU-intensive tasks.
```python
from multiprocessing import Process

process = Process(target=lambda: print("Process running"))
process.start()
process.join()
```
Conclusion: Use multithreading for I/O tasks and multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.


<a id='q14'></a>
# Do you know what a CPU is used for? How can we speed up processes with Python?

### Answer

#### **Role of a CPU**:
The **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) is the main processor of a computer that executes program instructions, such as performing calculations, managing data, and controlling peripherals.



#### **How to speed up processes with Python?**

1. **Multithreading** (for I/O-bound tasks):
   - Runs multiple threads to optimize input/output operations (e.g., network, files).
   - Limited for CPU-intensive tasks due to the GIL.

   ```python
   import threading

   def task():
       print("Task running")

   thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
   thread.start()
   thread.join()
   ```

**2. Multiprocessing** (for CPU-bound tasks):

Utilizes multiple CPU cores to parallelize heavy computations.
```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def task():
    print("Task running in parallel")

process = Process(target=task)
process.start()
process.join()
```
**3.NumPy and Pandas:**

Libraries optimized for fast mathematical computations and large data manipulation.
```python
import numpy as np

data = np.arange(1_000_000)
result = np.sum(data)  # Very fast
```
**3.Cython or Numba:**

Compiles parts of Python code to achieve performance close to C/C++.
```python
from numba import jit

@jit
def compute():
    return sum(i * i for i in range(10**6))

print(compute())
```
**4. Asynchronous Programming (for concurrent tasks):**


Uses asyncio for non-blocking task execution.
```python
import asyncio

async def task():
    print("Async task running")

asyncio.run(task())
```
Conclusion: To speed up Python processes, use multithreading or asynchronous programming for I/O tasks, and multiprocessing, NumPy, or Cython for CPU-intensive computations.

# What is one weakness of Python compared to C++?

### Answer

Python is slower than C++ because it is interpreted rather than compiled, resulting in less efficient execution, especially for CPU-intensive tasks. Additionally, Python is limited by the GIL, restricting its use of multiple cores for threads.

**Conclusion**: Python is easier to use, but C++ is significantly faster for high-performance applications.
