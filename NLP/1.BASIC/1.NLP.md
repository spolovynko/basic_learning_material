# Word Vectors and Related Concepts

## 1. Introduction to Word Vectors
Word vectors are numerical representations of words in a high-dimensional space that capture **semantic** and **syntactic** relationships between them. They allow machines to process language mathematically, enabling **better understanding** of meaning, context, and relationships between words.

## 2. Key Concepts in Word Vectors

### **2.1 One-Hot Encoding**
Before the rise of word vectors, words were represented using **one-hot encoding**, where each word was mapped to a unique binary vector.

#### **Characteristics:**
- Each word is represented as a **sparse vector** with one "1" and the rest "0s".
- No meaning is captured; words are **independent** of each other.

#### **Limitations:**
- Leads to a **curse of dimensionality** (large vocabulary = huge vectors).
- No **semantic similarity** is captured between words (e.g., "king" and "queen" are completely different vectors).

---

### **2.2 Distributed Representations & Word Embeddings**
To overcome the limitations of one-hot encoding, **word embeddings** were introduced. These are **dense vector representations** of words that capture relationships based on their context in large text corpora.

#### **Characteristics:**
- Words with similar meanings have **closer vectors**.
- Captures **semantic and syntactic** relationships (e.g., "man" is to "woman" as "king" is to "queen").
- Reduces **dimensionality** compared to one-hot encoding.

---

## 3. Word Embedding Techniques

### **3.1 Word2Vec (2013)**
A breakthrough neural network model developed by **Mikolov et al. at Google** that learns word embeddings using two architectures:
1. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** – Predicts the target word from surrounding context words.
2. **Skip-Gram** – Predicts surrounding words given a target word.

#### **Key Properties:**
- Produces dense, meaningful **word vectors**.
- Supports **vector arithmetic** (e.g., King - Man + Woman ≈ Queen).
- Uses **negative sampling** and **hierarchical softmax** for efficiency.

#### **Limitations:**
- Cannot handle **out-of-vocabulary (OOV)** words.
- Word meanings are **static** (e.g., "bank" always has the same vector whether referring to a "riverbank" or a "financial bank").

---

### **3.2 GloVe (2014)**
Developed by **Stanford NLP**, **Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe)** is based on **word co-occurrence statistics** rather than predicting words from context.

#### **Key Properties:**
- Constructs word vectors from **co-occurrence matrices** rather than **context-based prediction**.
- Efficient for training on **large corpora**.
- Captures **global context** better than Word2Vec.

#### **Limitations:**
- Still **static** (like Word2Vec), meaning it cannot handle **polysemy** (multiple meanings of a word).
- Requires a **large memory footprint** due to storing co-occurrence matrices.

---

### **3.3 FastText (2016)**
Developed by **Facebook AI**, **FastText** extends Word2Vec by considering **subword information**.

#### **Key Properties:**
- Represents words as **character n-grams**, making it robust to spelling variations and typos.
- Handles **out-of-vocabulary (OOV)** words better.
- Improves performance for languages with **rich morphology** (e.g., French, German).

#### **Limitations:**
- Increased computational complexity compared to Word2Vec.
- Performance gains depend on the language and dataset.

---

### **3.4 Contextual Word Embeddings**
Unlike Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, which assign **one vector per word**, contextual embeddings generate **different vectors for the same word depending on context**.

#### **Notable Models:**
1. **ELMo (2018)** – Contextual embeddings using bi-directional LSTMs.
2. **BERT (2018)** – Uses transformers and attention mechanisms to create highly contextual embeddings.
3. **GPT (2018-Present)** – Generates embeddings tailored for generative tasks.

#### **Advantages:**
- Captures **polysemy** (e.g., "bank" in "riverbank" vs. "financial bank" gets different vectors).
- Provides richer **semantic understanding**.
- Enables better performance in **downstream NLP tasks**.

---

## 4. Applications of Word Vectors
Word embeddings have revolutionized NLP and are widely used in:

- **Text Classification** – Spam detection, sentiment analysis.
- **Machine Translation** – Neural machine translation models.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Identifying people, locations, and entities in text.
- **Question Answering Systems** – Chatbots, virtual assistants.
- **Semantic Search** – Improving search engine results using meaning-based ranking.

---

## 5. Challenges & Future Directions

### **5.1 Challenges**
- **Bias in Word Embeddings** – Models can inherit **societal biases** present in training data.
- **Lack of Common Sense Reasoning** – Word vectors do not understand **causality** or **logic**.
- **Memory & Computation Costs** – Training large embeddings is resource-intensive.

### **5.2 Future Directions**
- **Unsupervised Pretraining** – Models like BERT and GPT continue to improve context understanding.
- **Multimodal Learning** – Combining text, images, and audio embeddings.
- **Fairness in NLP** – Developing debiased embeddings to reduce discrimination in AI applications.

---

## 6. Conclusion
Word vectors have transformed NLP, enabling more **human-like text understanding**. From early **one-hot encoding** to **contextual embeddings like BERT**, the journey of word representations has led to significant advancements in AI. However, challenges like **bias, interpretability, and efficiency** remain active research areas.

# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in NLP

## 1. Introduction
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed for **sequential data processing**, making them well-suited for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks where context and word order matter.

Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have **memory** that allows them to retain previous information, making them effective for tasks like **speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation**.

---

## 2. How RNNs Work
An RNN processes **sequential data** by maintaining a hidden state that carries information from **previous time steps**.

### **2.1 Basic RNN Structure**
An RNN consists of:
- **Input layer**: Receives a sequence of words or characters.
- **Hidden layer (with recurrent connection)**: Maintains a memory of past inputs.
- **Output layer**: Produces predictions based on the hidden state.

#### **Mathematical Representation**
At each time step t, the hidden state is updated as follows:

\[
h_t = f(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b)
\]

Where:
- h_t = hidden state at time step t
- h_{t-1} = hidden state from the previous time step
- x_t = current input (word embedding or character)
- W_h, W_x = weight matrices
- b = bias
- f = activation function (usually tanh or ReLU)

The final output is computed as:

\[
y_t = W_y h_t + b_y
\]

---

## 3. RNNs in NLP
### **3.1 Why Use RNNs for NLP?**
- **Sequential Data Processing**: Text is inherently sequential, and RNNs can **remember** past words.
- **Context Awareness**: Helps capture dependencies between words in a sentence.
- **Variable-Length Input Handling**: Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs can process **sentences of different lengths**.

### **3.2 Common NLP Tasks Using RNNs**
| NLP Task | Role of RNN |
|----------|------------|
| **Text Generation** | Predicts the next word/character based on previous words. |
| **Machine Translation** | Encodes a sentence in one language and decodes it into another. |
| **Speech Recognition** | Converts spoken words into text by recognizing sequential sound patterns. |
| **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Identifies important entities like names, locations, and organizations. |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | Determines the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a text. |

---

## 4. Challenges of Vanilla RNNs

### **4.1 Vanishing Gradient Problem**
- In long sequences, gradients shrink exponentially, causing early words to have **minimal impact** on later predictions.
- This limits RNNs' ability to **learn long-term dependencies**.

### **4.2 Exploding Gradient Problem**
- Opposite of vanishing gradients, where gradients **become too large**, leading to unstable training.
- Often mitigated using **gradient clipping**.

### **4.3 Memory Constraints**
- Standard RNNs struggle to **retain information over long sequences**, making them ineffective for **long-distance dependencies** in text.

---

## 5. Variants of RNNs to Address Limitations

### **5.1 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
LSTM is an advanced RNN variant that introduces **gates** to control information flow, solving the vanishing gradient problem.

#### **LSTM Cell Components**
- **Forget Gate** (f_t) – Decides what information to discard.
- **Input Gate** (i_t) – Determines which new information to add.
- **Cell State** (C_t) – Stores long-term dependencies.
- **Output Gate** (o_t) – Produces the next hidden state.

LSTMs allow RNNs to **remember context over longer sequences**, making them ideal for NLP tasks like **chatbots, question answering, and language modeling**.

---

### **5.2 Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
A simpler alternative to LSTMs, **GRUs** combine the forget and input gates into a **single update gate**, making them computationally **faster** while performing similarly to LSTMs.

#### **Key Differences Between LSTMs and GRUs**
| Feature | LSTM | GRU |
|---------|------|-----|
| Complexity | More complex (3 gates) | Simpler (2 gates) |
| Memory Efficiency | Requires more parameters | More efficient |
| Performance | Better for long sequences | Works well for medium-length sequences |

---

---

### **6.2 Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Model**
A special RNN-based architecture for tasks requiring **input and output sequences of different lengths** (e.g., machine translation).

**Components:**
1. **Encoder RNN**: Processes input and compresses it into a **fixed-size vector** (context vector).
2. **Decoder RNN**: Generates the output sequence from the context vector.

**Applications:**

- Chatbots

---

## 7. The Rise of Transformers: Replacing RNNs
Despite their success, RNNs are increasingly being replaced by **Transformer models** (e.g., BERT, GPT) due to:
- **Parallel Processing**: RNNs process text sequentially, while Transformers **process all words at once**.
- **Better Long-Distance Context Handling**: Transformers use **self-attention** mechanisms to understand dependencies between words, even when far apart.

**Example:**
- **GPT and BERT** leverage **transformer architectures** for superior NLP performance, overtaking RNN-based approaches.

---

## 8. Conclusion
RNNs revolutionized NLP by enabling **context-aware language models** but faced limitations in handling **long-term dependencies**. Innovations like **LSTMs, GRUs, and Bi-RNNs** improved performance, but **transformers have largely replaced RNNs** for most NLP tasks.

**Key Takeaways:**
- RNNs are powerful for **sequence-based NLP tasks**.
- **LSTMs and GRUs** solve the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Bi-RNNs and Seq2Seq models** enhance performance in tasks like machine translation.
- **Transformers** have largely **replaced RNNs** due to efficiency and better handling of long-range dependencies.
