# SINGLETON

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Ensure a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.  |
| **Use Case**         | Shared resources like database connections, logging systems, or configuration.  |
| **Key Idea**         | The first object is created and stored, and subsequent requests return the same instance. |
| **How It Works**     | Uses a class-level variable (`_instance`) to track and reuse the single instance. |
| **Real-Life Example**| A control panel, where all users share the same panel instead of creating multiple ones. |

# Python Code Example

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None  # Class-level variable to store the single instance

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            print("Creating the Singleton instance...")
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Example usage:
singleton1 = Singleton()
singleton2 = Singleton()

print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # Output: True
```

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Define a method to create objects without specifying their exact class.                             |
| **Use Case**         | When you need to decide which object to create at runtime based on some input or logic.             |
| **Key Idea**         | A central method or class is responsible for creating and returning objects of different types.      |
| **How It Works**     | A factory method takes input (e.g., a type) and decides which class or object to instantiate.        |
| **Real-Life Example**| A toy store: You ask for a type of toy (e.g., car, doll), and the store gives you the appropriate toy.|

# Python Code Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Product Interface
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass

# Concrete Products
class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a Circle!"

class Square(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a Square!"

# Factory
class ShapeFactory:
    def create_shape(self, shape_type):
        if shape_type == "circle":
            return Circle()
        elif shape_type == "square":
            return Square()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown shape type")

# Example usage
factory = ShapeFactory()

shape1 = factory.create_shape("circle")
print(shape1.draw())  # Output: Drawing a Circle!

shape2 = factory.create_shape("square")
print(shape2.draw())  # Output: Drawing a Square!

# ABSTRACT FACTORY

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Provide an interface to create **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes. |
| **Use Case**         | When your system needs to support multiple families of products that are related (e.g., GUI components for different operating systems). |
| **Key Idea**         | A factory creates a family of related products, ensuring compatibility between them.                |
| **How It Works**     | The client uses an abstract factory interface to create objects, and concrete factories implement this interface for specific families. |
| **Real-Life Example**| A theme-based UI toolkit: If you choose "Light Theme," you get light buttons and checkboxes. If you choose "Dark Theme," you get dark buttons and checkboxes. |

# Python Code Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Product Interfaces
class Button(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self):
        pass

class Checkbox(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self):
        pass

# Concrete Products for Light Theme
class LightButton(Button):
    def render(self):
        return "Rendering Light Button"

class LightCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def render(self):
        return "Rendering Light Checkbox"

# Concrete Products for Dark Theme
class DarkButton(Button):
    def render(self):
        return "Rendering Dark Button"

class DarkCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def render(self):
        return "Rendering Dark Checkbox"

# Abstract Factory Interface
class UIFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_checkbox(self):
        pass

# Concrete Factories
class LightThemeFactory(UIFactory):
    def create_button(self):
        return LightButton()

    def create_checkbox(self):
        return LightCheckbox()

class DarkThemeFactory(UIFactory):
    def create_button(self):
        return DarkButton()

    def create_checkbox(self):
        return DarkCheckbox()

# Client Code
def render_ui(factory: UIFactory):
    button = factory.create_button()
    checkbox = factory.create_checkbox()
    print(button.render())    # Render the button
    print(checkbox.render())  # Render the checkbox

# Example usage
theme = input("Choose theme (light/dark): ").strip().lower()

if theme == "light":
    factory = LightThemeFactory()
elif theme == "dark":
    factory = DarkThemeFactory()
else:
    raise ValueError("Unknown theme")

# BUILDER

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                     |

| **Purpose**          | Construct a complex object step-by-step and allow different representations of the object using the same process. |
| **Use Case**         | When creating an object involves many steps or configurations, and you want to separate the construction process from the final object. |
| **Key Idea**         | Break down the construction of a complex object into smaller, manageable steps (methods).           |
| **How It Works**     | A builder class provides methods for constructing parts of the object, and a director class (optional) orchestrates the building process. |
| **Real-Life Example**| Building a custom pizza: You add a crust, sauce, toppings, and cheese step by step to assemble the pizza. |

# Python Code Example

```python
# Product
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = None
        self.color = None
        self.wheels = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Car(engine={self.engine}, color={self.color}, wheels={self.wheels})"

# Builder
class CarBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.car = Car()

    def set_engine(self, engine):
        self.car.engine = engine
        return self

    def set_color(self, color):
        self.car.color = color
        return self

    def set_wheels(self, wheels):
        self.car.wheels = wheels
        return self

    def build(self):
        return self.car

# Director (Optional)
class CarDirector:
    def __init__(self, builder):
        self.builder = builder

    def construct_sports_car(self):
        return (
            self.builder
            .set_engine("V8 Turbo")
            .set_color("Red")
            .set_wheels(4)
            .build()
        )

    def construct_family_car(self):
        return (
            self.builder
            .set_engine("V6")
            .set_color("Blue")
            .set_wheels(4)
            .build()
        )

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    builder = CarBuilder()
    director = CarDirector(builder)

    # Build a sports car
    sports_car = director.construct_sports_car()
    print(sports_car)  # Output: Car(engine=V8 Turbo, color=Red, wheels=4)

    # Build a family car
    family_car = director.construct_family_car()
    print(family_car)  # Output: Car(engine=V6, color=Blue, wheels=4)

# PROTOTYPE

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Create new objects by copying an existing object (a prototype) instead of instantiating new ones directly. |
| **Use Case**         | When object creation is expensive (e.g., complex initialization, large data), and you need many similar objects. |
| **Key Idea**         | Use an existing object as a template to clone new objects, reducing the cost of creation.           |
| **How It Works**     | Implement a `clone` method that creates a copy of the object.                                       |
| **Real-Life Example**| A factory copying an existing mold to create similar items without redoing the entire design.        |

# Python Code Example

```python
import copy

# Prototype Base Class
class Prototype:
    def clone(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)

# Concrete Prototype
class Car(Prototype):
    def __init__(self, model, color, engine):
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.engine = engine

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Car(model={self.model}, color={self.color}, engine={self.engine})"

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an original car
    original_car = Car(model="Sedan", color="Blue", engine="V6")
    print(f"Original: {original_car}")  # Output: Original: Car(model=Sedan, color=Blue, engine=V6)

    # Clone the car
    cloned_car = original_car.clone()
    cloned_car.color = "Red"  # Modify the clone's color
    print(f"Cloned: {cloned_car}")  # Output: Cloned: Car(model=Sedan, color=Red, engine=V6)

    # The original remains unchanged
    print(f"Original after cloning: {original_car}")  # Output: Original: Car(model=Sedan, color=Blue, engine=V6)

# Extensive Description: Real Cases for Using Patterns

## 1. **Singleton**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Database Connection Pool**: A single instance of the connection pool ensures all database operations use the same connections efficiently.
  - **Logging System**: A single logging instance ensures that logs from all parts of the application are centralized.

---

## 2. **Factory Method**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Payment Gateway Integration**: A payment system can use a factory method to choose between different payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) based on user input or location.
  - **Document Parser**: Create specific parsers (e.g., XMLParser, JSONParser) based on the file format.

---

## 3. **Abstract Factory**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Cross-Platform GUI Library**: Abstract Factory ensures UI components (like buttons, checkboxes, and sliders) are compatible with different operating systems (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux).
  - **Game Development**: Abstract Factory creates related game objects, such as terrain, characters, and obstacles, specific to a theme (e.g., "forest" theme vs. "desert" theme).

---

## 4. **Builder**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Car Manufacturing**: Builders customize cars with specific engines, colors, and wheel types. Each builder creates a different car configuration (e.g., sedan vs. SUV).
  - **Report Generator**: A builder can create reports in different formats (PDF, Excel) by adding content step by step (e.g., headers, data tables, charts).

---

## 5. **Prototype**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Game Development**: Clone a base character prototype with default stats and customize specific attributes (e.g., health, speed).
  - **Data Science Pipelines**: Clone a preprocessed dataset object to try different machine learning models without reloading or preprocessing the data.

| **Prototype**        | Create new objects by copying an existing object (a prototype).                                | Use when object creation is expensive (e.g., deep configuration, large datasets) and when you need multiple objects with the same initial state but independent modifications.                                                                    | - Relies on cloning.<br>- Reduces creation cost.<br>- Preserves the state of the original object in clones.       | **Game Characters**: Clone a base character with default attributes and modify only specific traits.            | Cloning a car or duplicating documents in a word processor.                                   |
