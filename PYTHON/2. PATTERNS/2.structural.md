# ADAPTER

# Adapter Design Pattern

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another one expected by the client. |
| **Use Case**         | When you have a class with an existing interface, but you need it to work with a different interface.    |
| **Key Idea**         | Wrap an existing class with a new interface that clients can use.                                       |
| **How It Works**     | The adapter class bridges the gap by translating the interface of one class into a form compatible with another. |
| **Real-Life Example**| A power adapter converts the plug shape or voltage of a device to make it compatible with a different socket. |

## Python Code Example

```python
# Target interface expected by the client
class EuropeanSocketInterface:
    def voltage(self):
        pass

    def live(self):
        pass

    def neutral(self):
        pass

# Adaptee class with a different interface
class USASocket:
    def usa_voltage(self):
        return 120

    def usa_live(self):
        return 1

    def usa_neutral(self):
        return -1

# Adapter class to bridge the gap
class SocketAdapter(EuropeanSocketInterface):
    def __init__(self, usa_socket):
        self.usa_socket = usa_socket

    def voltage(self):
        return 230  # Converts voltage to European standard

    def live(self):
        return self.usa_socket.usa_live()

    def neutral(self):
        return self.usa_socket.usa_neutral()

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Adaptee
    usa_socket = USASocket()

    # Adapter
    adapter = SocketAdapter(usa_socket)

    # Client interacting with the target interface
    print("European Voltage:", adapter.voltage())  # Output: European Voltage: 230
    print("Live:", adapter.live())                 # Output: Live: 1
    print("Neutral:", adapter.neutral())           # Output: Neutral: -1

# BRIDGE


| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.                |
| **Use Case**         | When you need to separate abstraction and implementation to avoid a strong dependency between them.      |
| **Key Idea**         | Use a bridge to connect the abstraction to its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.    |
| **How It Works**     | Define an interface for the abstraction and a separate interface for the implementation, and then bridge them through composition. |
| **Real-Life Example**| A remote control (abstraction) that works with different devices like TVs or music systems (implementations). |

## Python Code Example

```python
# Implementation interface
class Device:
    def power_on(self):
        pass

    def power_off(self):
        pass

    def set_volume(self, level):
        pass

# Concrete implementation
class TV(Device):
    def power_on(self):
        print("TV is now ON")

    def power_off(self):
        print("TV is now OFF")

    def set_volume(self, level):
        print(f"TV volume set to {level}")

class Radio(Device):
    def power_on(self):
        print("Radio is now ON")

    def power_off(self):
        print("Radio is now OFF")

    def set_volume(self, level):
        print(f"Radio volume set to {level}")

# Abstraction
class RemoteControl:
    def __init__(self, device):
        self.device = device

    def toggle_power(self):
        pass

    def adjust_volume(self, level):
        self.device.set_volume(level)

# Refined abstraction
class BasicRemote(RemoteControl):
    def toggle_power(self):
        print("Toggling power using BasicRemote")
        self.device.power_on()

class AdvancedRemote(RemoteControl):
    def toggle_power(self):
        print("Toggling power using AdvancedRemote")
        self.device.power_off()

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Concrete implementations
    tv = TV()
    radio = Radio()

    # Abstraction with implementations
    basic_remote = BasicRemote(tv)
    advanced_remote = AdvancedRemote(radio)

    # Using the remotes
    basic_remote.toggle_power()  # Output: Toggling power using BasicRemote \n TV is now ON
    basic_remote.adjust_volume(10)  # Output: TV volume set to 10

    advanced_remote.toggle_power()  # Output: Toggling power using AdvancedRemote \n Radio is now OFF
    advanced_remote.adjust_volume(5)  # Output: Radio volume set to 5

# COMPOSITE

# Composite Design Pattern

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. |
| **Use Case**         | When you need to represent a hierarchy of objects, and you want to treat individual objects and groups of objects the same way. |
| **Key Idea**         | Use a common interface for both individual components and composites, enabling recursive composition.    |
| **How It Works**     | Define a base component interface. Leaf objects implement this interface, and composite objects contain multiple child components that also implement the same interface. |
| **Real-Life Example**| A file system where files and folders can be treated the same way (e.g., folders can contain files or other folders). |

## Python Code Example

```python
# Component interface
class FileSystemComponent:
    def show(self):
        pass

# Leaf class
class File(FileSystemComponent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def show(self):
        print(f"File: {self.name}")

# Composite class
class Folder(FileSystemComponent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.children = []

    def add(self, component):
        self.children.append(component)

    def remove(self, component):
        self.children.remove(component)

    def show(self):
        print(f"Folder: {self.name}")
        for child in self.children:
            child.show()

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Leaf nodes
    file1 = File("file1.txt")
    file2 = File("file2.txt")
    file3 = File("file3.txt")

    # Composite nodes
    folder1 = Folder("Folder1")
    folder2 = Folder("Folder2")

    # Building the hierarchy
    folder1.add(file1)
    folder1.add(file2)

    folder2.add(file3)
    folder2.add(folder1)

    # Display the structure
    folder2.show()
    # Output:
    # Folder: Folder2
    # File: file3.txt
    # Folder: Folder1
    # File: file1.txt
    # File: file2.txt
```

# DECORATOR

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Dynamically add new behaviors or responsibilities to objects without modifying their code.             |
| **Use Case**         | When you need to extend the behavior of objects at runtime, avoiding subclassing or modifying existing code. |
| **Key Idea**         | Wrap objects with additional functionality using decorators, which follow the same interface as the objects they wrap. |
| **How It Works**     | Implement a decorator class that has the same interface as the object it decorates, and use composition to add new functionality. |
| **Real-Life Example**| Adding layers of clothing for warmth (e.g., wearing a jacket over a shirt) without altering the shirt or jacket. |

## Python Code Example

```python
# Component interface
class Coffee:
    def cost(self):
        pass

    def description(self):
        pass

# Concrete component
class BasicCoffee(Coffee):
    def cost(self):
        return 2

    def description(self):
        return "Basic Coffee"

# Decorator base class
class CoffeeDecorator(Coffee):
    def __init__(self, coffee):
        self._coffee = coffee

    def cost(self):
        return self._coffee.cost()

    def description(self):
        return self._coffee.description()

# Concrete decorators
class MilkDecorator(CoffeeDecorator):
    def cost(self):
        return self._coffee.cost() + 0.5

    def description(self):
        return self._coffee.description() + ", Milk"

class SugarDecorator(CoffeeDecorator):
    def cost(self):
        return self._coffee.cost() + 0.2

    def description(self):
        return self._coffee.description() + ", Sugar"

class VanillaDecorator(CoffeeDecorator):
    def cost(self):
        return self._coffee.cost() + 0.7

    def description(self):
        return self._coffee.description() + ", Vanilla"

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Basic coffee
    coffee = BasicCoffee()
    print(f"Description: {coffee.description()} | Cost: ${coffee.cost():.2f}")

    # Add milk
    coffee_with_milk = MilkDecorator(coffee)
    print(f"Description: {coffee_with_milk.description()} | Cost: ${coffee_with_milk.cost():.2f}")

    # Add milk and sugar
    coffee_with_milk_and_sugar = SugarDecorator(coffee_with_milk)
    print(f"Description: {coffee_with_milk_and_sugar.description()} | Cost: ${coffee_with_milk_and_sugar.cost():.2f}")

    # Add milk, sugar, and vanilla
    fancy_coffee = VanillaDecorator(coffee_with_milk_and_sugar)
    print(f"Description: {fancy_coffee.description()} | Cost: ${fancy_coffee.cost():.2f}")
```

# FACADE

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Provide a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.               |
| **Use Case**         | When you need to simplify interaction with a complex system or set of classes for clients.              |
| **Key Idea**         | Encapsulate the complexity of a system behind a single interface, hiding its implementation details.     |
| **How It Works**     | The facade class provides high-level methods that internally delegate calls to the subsystem's components. |
| **Real-Life Example**| A universal remote control simplifies interacting with various devices like a TV, sound system, and DVD player. |

## Python Code Example

```python
# Subsystem classes
class CPU:
    def freeze(self):
        print("Freezing processor...")

    def jump(self, position):
        print(f"Jumping to memory position {position}...")

    def execute(self):
        print("Executing instructions...")

class Memory:
    def load(self, position, data):
        print(f"Loading data '{data}' into memory position {position}...")

class HardDrive:
    def read(self, lba, size):
        print(f"Reading {size} bytes from LBA {lba}...")
        return "data"

# Facade class
class Computer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cpu = CPU()
        self.memory = Memory()
        self.hard_drive = HardDrive()

    def start(self):
        print("Starting the computer...")
        self.cpu.freeze()
        data = self.hard_drive.read(0, 1024)
        self.memory.load(0, data)
        self.cpu.jump(0)
        self.cpu.execute()

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Client code
    computer = Computer()
    computer.start()
```

# FLYWEIGHT

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.                        |
| **Use Case**         | When you need to create a large number of objects, and many of them share common data.                  |
| **Key Idea**         | Store shared data in a central location and use unique extrinsic data to differentiate between objects.  |
| **How It Works**     | Use a factory or manager to create and manage shared objects (flyweights) and provide them as needed.    |
| **Real-Life Example**| Text rendering systems where each character (glyph) is stored once and reused with different formatting. |

## Python Code Example

```python
# Flyweight class
class TreeType:
    def __init__(self, name, color, texture):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        self.texture = texture

    def display(self, x, y):
        print(f"Displaying {self.name} tree at ({x}, {y}) with color {self.color} and texture {self.texture}")

# Flyweight factory
class TreeFactory:
    _tree_types = {}

    @staticmethod
    def get_tree_type(name, color, texture):
        key = (name, color, texture)
        if key not in TreeFactory._tree_types:
            TreeFactory._tree_types[key] = TreeType(name, color, texture)
            print(f"Creating new tree type: {name}")
        return TreeFactory._tree_types[key]

# Context class
class Tree:
    def __init__(self, x, y, tree_type):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.tree_type = tree_type

    def display(self):
        self.tree_type.display(self.x, self.y)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Forest simulation
    forest = []
    tree_types = [
        ("Oak", "Green", "Rough"),
        ("Pine", "Dark Green", "Smooth"),
        ("Birch", "Yellow", "Striped"),
    ]

    for i in range(5):  # Adding trees to the forest
        for name, color, texture in tree_types:
            tree_type = TreeFactory.get_tree_type(name, color, texture)
            forest.append(Tree(i * 10, i * 15, tree_type))

    # Display all trees
    for tree in forest:
        tree.display()
```

# PROXY

| **Aspect**          | **Explanation**                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Provide a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.                         |
| **Use Case**         | When you want to add a layer of control, such as access control, lazy initialization, logging, or caching, before accessing the actual object. |
| **Key Idea**         | The proxy implements the same interface as the real object and delegates calls to it while adding additional behavior. |
| **How It Works**     | A proxy class wraps the real object and intercepts method calls, adding custom logic before or after forwarding the calls. |
| **Real-Life Example**| A bank ATM acts as a proxy for a bank, handling access and authentication before granting services.      |

## Python Code Example

```python
# Subject interface
class Subject:
    def request(self):
        pass

# Real subject
class RealSubject(Subject):
    def request(self):
        print("RealSubject: Handling request.")

# Proxy
class Proxy(Subject):
    def __init__(self, real_subject):
        self._real_subject = real_subject

    def request(self):
        if self._check_access():
            self._real_subject.request()
            self._log_access()

    def _check_access(self):
        print("Proxy: Checking access prior to firing a real request.")
        # Access control logic here (e.g., authentication)
        return True

    def _log_access(self):
        print("Proxy: Logging the access to the real subject.")

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Real object
    real_subject = RealSubject()

    # Proxy
    proxy = Proxy(real_subject)

    # Client interacts with the proxy
    print("Client: Accessing through the proxy...")
    proxy.request()
```

| **Adapter**          | Converts the interface of a class into another interface expected by the client.               | Use when you need to make a class with an incompatible interface work with other classes or systems.                                                                                                        | - Acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.<br>- No need to modify existing code.<br>- Easy to extend. | **Power Adapter**: Converts voltage and plug shape for compatibility.                                            | Adapting a legacy payment system to work with a new e-commerce platform.                    |
| **Bridge**           | Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so they can vary independently.               | Use when you need to extend both abstraction and implementation hierarchies independently without causing a combinatorial explosion of subclasses.                                                           | - Uses composition to separate abstraction and implementation.<br>- Promotes flexibility and scalability.         | **Remote Controls**: A universal remote can work with multiple devices like TVs, radios, etc.                   | Remote controlling different devices (e.g., TVs or music players) through a common interface. |

# Extensive Description: Real Cases for Using Patterns

## 1. **Adapter**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Power Adapter**: Converts voltage and plug shape to make electrical devices compatible with foreign outlets.
  - **API Wrapping**: Wraps a legacy API to make it compatible with a modern application.

---

## 2. **Bridge**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Remote Control**: Decouples the remote's interface from specific device implementations (e.g., TV, radio).
  - **Graphic Rendering**: Separates shape abstractions (e.g., circle, rectangle) from rendering implementations (e.g., vector, raster).

---

## 3. **Composite**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **File System**: Folders can contain files or other folders, and operations like size calculation can be applied uniformly.
  - **UI Components**: GUI elements like panels contain other components (e.g., buttons, text fields), and they are treated uniformly.

---

## 4. **Decorator**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Coffee Orders**: Add sugar, milk, or other flavors dynamically to a basic coffee.
  - **Logging**: Dynamically add logging to specific parts of an application without altering existing code.

---

## 5. **Facade**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Home Automation System**: Provides a single interface to control lights, heating, and security systems.
  - **Library Management**: Simplifies access to a library system's multiple subsystems for borrowing, returning, and cataloging books.

---

## 6. **Flyweight**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Text Rendering**: Characters share font and style properties while maintaining their unique positions in a document.
  - **Game Development**: Use shared graphical assets for repeated objects like trees or NPCs in a game world.

---

## 7. **Proxy**
- **Real-Case Example**:
  - **Virtual Proxy**: Loads large images in a document only when they are visible to the user.
  - **Security Proxy**: Controls access to sensitive operations or data, such as an admin panel.
