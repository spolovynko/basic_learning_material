# Python Integers

Integers are one of the fundamental data types in Python, representing whole numbers. Python provides extensive support for integers, including various operations, constructors, and representations in different bases. This document elaborates on the key aspects of integers, their operations, and their relationship to rational numbers.

---

## 1. **Integer Data Type**
- Integers in Python are of type `int`.
- They can hold arbitrarily large values, as Python automatically allocates more memory for larger integers.

### Example:
```python
x = 42  # A positive integer
y = -7  # A negative integer
z = 0   # Zero

print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

### Characteristics:
- No predefined size limit (unlike C or Java).
- Stored in memory as variable-length objects.

---

## 2. **Integer Operations**
Python supports a variety of arithmetic and bitwise operations on integers.

### 2.1 Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition (`+`)**: `x + y`
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: `x - y`
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: `x * y`
- **Division (`/`)**: `x / y` (result is a float).
- **Floor Division (`//`)**: `x // y` (result is an integer).
- **Modulo (`%`)**: `x % y`
- **Exponentiation (`**`)**: `x ** y`

#### Example:
```python
a = 15
b = 4

print(a + b)   # Output: 19
print(a / b)   # Output: 3.75
print(a // b)  # Output: 3
print(a % b)   # Output: 3
```

### 2.2 Bitwise Operations
- **AND (`&`)**
- **OR (`|`)**
- **XOR (`^`)**
- **NOT (`~`)**
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**

#### Example:
```python
a = 5  # Binary: 0101
b = 3  # Binary: 0011

print(a & b)  # Output: 1 (Binary: 0001)
print(a | b)  # Output: 7 (Binary: 0111)
print(a ^ b)  # Output: 6 (Binary: 0110)
print(~a)     # Output: -6 (Two's complement)
```

---

## 3. **Integer Constructors**
You can create integers in Python using the `int()` constructor.

### Syntax:
```python
int(value, base=10)
```
- `value`: A string, float, or another type to convert.
- `base`: The numeric base (default is 10).

### Example:
```python
print(int("42"))       # Output: 42
print(int("101", 2))   # Output: 5 (binary to decimal)
print(int("A", 16))    # Output: 10 (hexadecimal to decimal)
```

---

## 4. **Integer Representations and Bases**
Integers can be represented in different numeric bases, such as binary, octal, and hexadecimal.

### Base Representations:
- **Binary (Base 2):** Prefix `0b` or `0B`.
- **Octal (Base 8):** Prefix `0o` or `0O`.
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** Prefix `0x` or `0X`.

#### Example:
```python
x = 0b1010   # Binary (10 in decimal)
y = 0o12     # Octal (10 in decimal)
z = 0xA      # Hexadecimal (10 in decimal)

print(x, y, z)  # Output: 10 10 10
```

### Conversion Functions:
- **`bin()`**: Converts an integer to binary.
- **`oct()`**: Converts an integer to octal.
- **`hex()`**: Converts an integer to hexadecimal.

#### Example:
```python
num = 42
print(bin(num))  # Output: 0b101010
print(oct(num))  # Output: 0o52
print(hex(num))  # Output: 0x2a
```

---

## 5. **Integers and Rational Numbers**
Python provides the `fractions` module to work with rational numbers, which represent fractions as a numerator and denominator.

### Using the `fractions` Module:
```python
from fractions import Fraction

frac = Fraction(3, 4)  # Represents 3/4
print(frac)            # Output: 3/4
print(float(frac))     # Output: 0.75

# Operations with fractions
frac1 = Fraction(1, 3)
frac2 = Fraction(2, 3)
print(frac1 + frac2)   # Output: 1 (3/3)
```

---

## 6. **Best Practices**
1. **Use Integer Division Where Necessary:**
   - Use `//` for division when the result should be an integer.

2. **Understand Base Conversions:**
   - Use constructors and built-in functions like `int()`, `bin()`, `oct()`, and `hex()` for working with different bases.

3. **Use Fractions for Precision:**
   - Use the `fractions` module to handle precise rational numbers instead of floating-point approximations.

4. **Optimize Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Python’s integers are highly optimized, but avoid unnecessary computations in performance-critical code.

---

## 7. **Conclusion**
Integers in Python are versatile and powerful, supporting a wide range of operations and representations. Understanding their properties, constructors, and relationship with rational numbers enables developers to handle numerical computations efficiently and effectively.

# Python Floats

Floating-point numbers (floats) in Python represent real numbers with decimal points. They are a core data type and are widely used for numerical computations. Understanding how floats work, including their internal representation, equality testing, coercion, and rounding, is essential for accurate and efficient programming.

---

## 1. **What are Floats?**
- Floats represent numbers with a fractional component, such as `3.14` or `-0.001`.
- They are implemented using the IEEE 754 standard for double-precision floating-point numbers.

### Example:
```python
x = 3.14
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'float'>
```

---

## 2. **Internal Representation**
Floats are represented internally as binary fractions. Due to this, some decimal numbers cannot be represented exactly, leading to precision errors.

### Key Points:
- Floats are stored as a sign, exponent, and fraction (mantissa).
- The precision is limited to about 15–17 significant decimal digits.

### Example of Precision Error:
```python
x = 0.1 + 0.2
print(x)  # Output: 0.30000000000000004 (not exactly 0.3)
```
This occurs because `0.1` and `0.2` cannot be precisely represented in binary.

### Tools for Inspecting Floats:
- **`decimal` module**: Offers arbitrary-precision decimal numbers.
- **`fractions` module**: Provides exact rational representations.

```python
from decimal import Decimal
x = Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.2')
print(x)  # Output: 0.3
```

---

## 3. **Equality Testing**
Due to precision issues, direct equality comparisons with floats can lead to unexpected results.

### Example:
```python
x = 0.1 + 0.2
y = 0.3
print(x == y)  # Output: False
```

### Best Practices:
1. **Use a Tolerance for Comparisons:**
   Use the `math.isclose()` function to compare floats within a small tolerance.
   ```python
   import math
   print(math.isclose(x, y, rel_tol=1e-9))  # Output: True
   ```

2. **Avoid Equality for Derived Values:**
   Compare results using tolerances rather than exact equality.

---

## 4. **Coercing Floats to Integers**
Floats can be coerced (converted) to integers in several ways, depending on the desired behavior.

### Methods:
1. **Truncation:**
   Use `int()` to remove the fractional part.
   ```python
   x = 3.99
   print(int(x))  # Output: 3
   ```

2. **Flooring:**
   Use `math.floor()` to round down to the nearest integer.
   ```python
   import math
   print(math.floor(x))  # Output: 3
   ```

3. **Ceiling:**
   Use `math.ceil()` to round up to the nearest integer.
   ```python
   print(math.ceil(x))  # Output: 4
   ```

4. **Rounding to the Nearest Integer:**
   Use `round()` to round to the nearest integer.
   ```python
   print(round(x))  # Output: 4
   ```

---

## 5. **Rounding Floats**
Python provides multiple ways to round floats, depending on precision requirements.

### Methods:
1. **Round to Nearest:**
   The `round()` function rounds to the nearest value, with ties rounded to the nearest even number (bankers’ rounding).
   ```python
   print(round(2.5))  # Output: 2
   print(round(3.5))  # Output: 4
   ```

2. **Round to Specific Decimal Places:**
   Specify the number of decimal places in `round()`.
   ```python
   x = 3.14159
   print(round(x, 2))  # Output: 3.14
   ```

3. **Custom Rounding:**
   Use the `decimal` module for more precise rounding options.
   ```python
   from decimal import Decimal, ROUND_HALF_UP
   x = Decimal('2.675')
   print(x.quantize(Decimal('0.01'), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP))  # Output: 2.68
   ```

---

## 6. **Best Practices with Floats**
1. **Use Alternatives for Exact Arithmetic:**
   - Use the `decimal` or `fractions` module for precise calculations.

2. **Avoid Direct Equality Checks:**
   - Use `math.isclose()` or tolerances for comparisons.

3. **Understand Precision Limitations:**
   - Be aware of potential rounding errors in critical computations.

4. **Use Rounding for Outputs:**
   - Round floats to the required precision when displaying or storing results.

---

## 7. **Conclusion**
Floats are a versatile and essential data type in Python, but their behavior can sometimes lead to surprises due to precision limitations. By understanding their internal representation, using best practices for equality testing and coercion, and leveraging rounding techniques, you can effectively manage floats in your programs.

# Python Decimals

The `decimal` module in Python provides a `Decimal` data type for high-precision arithmetic. It is particularly useful for financial calculations and other applications requiring precise decimal representation and control over rounding.

---

## 1. **Decimal Data Type**
- The `Decimal` data type is part of the `decimal` module and offers more precision and control than Python’s built-in `float` type.
- Decimals avoid the precision issues associated with floating-point arithmetic by using base-10 representation.

### Example:
```python
from decimal import Decimal

x = Decimal("0.1")
y = Decimal("0.2")
z = x + y
print(z)  # Output: 0.3 (precise representation)
```

### Characteristics:
- Immutable.
- Allows user-defined precision.
- Provides exact arithmetic for base-10 numbers.

---

## 2. **Constructors and Contexts**
### 2.1 Creating Decimals
Decimals can be created using the `Decimal` constructor.

#### Example:
```python
from decimal import Decimal

# From a string (preferred)
d1 = Decimal("0.1")
print(d1)  # Output: 0.1

# From an integer or float
d2 = Decimal(10)
d3 = Decimal(0.1)  # Note: Converting from float may introduce precision issues
print(d3)  # Output: 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625
```

### 2.2 Decimal Contexts
Contexts control various settings for `Decimal` operations, including precision, rounding method, and error handling.

#### Example:
```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

# Set precision to 5 digits
getcontext().prec = 5
d = Decimal("1.23456789") + Decimal("2.3456789")
print(d)  # Output: 3.5802 (rounded to 5 significant digits)
```

---

## 3. **Math Operations with Decimals**
The `Decimal` type supports standard arithmetic operations as well as advanced mathematical functions through the `decimal` module.

### 3.1 Basic Arithmetic
- **Addition (`+`)**: `Decimal("0.1") + Decimal("0.2")`
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: `Decimal("0.3") - Decimal("0.1")`
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: `Decimal("0.2") * Decimal("0.3")`
- **Division (`/`)**: `Decimal("0.3") / Decimal("0.2")`

#### Example:
```python
x = Decimal("1.1")
y = Decimal("2.2")
z = x * y
print(z)  # Output: 2.42
```

### 3.2 Mathematical Functions
The `decimal` module provides additional functions, such as:
- `sqrt()`: Square root.
- `ln()`: Natural logarithm.
- `exp()`: Exponential.
- `quantize()`: Rounds a `Decimal` to a fixed number of decimal places.

#### Example:
```python
from decimal import Decimal

x = Decimal("2.25")
sqrt_x = x.sqrt()
print(sqrt_x)  # Output: 1.5

rounded_x = x.quantize(Decimal("0.1"))
print(rounded_x)  # Output: 2.3
```

---

## 4. **Performance Considerations**
### 4.1 Performance vs Float
- Decimals are more precise but slower than `float`.
- Operations on `Decimal` objects involve higher computational overhead due to additional precision and configurable contexts.

#### Example:
```python
import time
from decimal import Decimal

# Float operation
a = 0.1
b = 0.2
start = time.time()
result_float = a + b
end = time.time()
print("Float time:", end - start)

# Decimal operation
d1 = Decimal("0.1")
d2 = Decimal("0.2")
start = time.time()
result_decimal = d1 + d2
end = time.time()
print("Decimal time:", end - start)
```

### 4.2 Optimizing Decimal Performance
- Use `float` for operations where precision is not critical.
- Use `Decimal` selectively for critical sections requiring exact calculations.
- Adjust context precision to balance accuracy and performance.

---

## 5. **Best Practices**
1. **Use Strings for Initialization:**
   - Construct `Decimal` objects from strings to avoid precision errors.
   ```python
   x = Decimal("0.1")  # Preferred
   y = Decimal(0.1)    # Avoid (introduces precision issues)
   ```

2. **Set Context Precision:**
   - Configure context precision globally or locally based on requirements.
   ```python
   from decimal import getcontext
   getcontext().prec = 10
   ```

3. **Avoid Overusing Decimals:**
   - Use `Decimal` only when precision is critical, such as in financial calculations.

4. **Leverage Quantization:**
   - Use `quantize()` to standardize decimal places and ensure consistent results.

---

## 6. **Conclusion**
The `Decimal` data type is a powerful tool for handling high-precision arithmetic in Python. By understanding its constructors, contexts, and operations, you can harness its capabilities effectively for applications requiring exact decimal representation and control over rounding. However, due to its performance overhead, use `Decimal` judiciously and prefer `float` for non-critical operations.

<a id='boolean'></a>
# Python Booleans

Booleans in Python represent one of the simplest data types and are used to denote truth values. They play a fundamental role in decision-making and logical operations in Python programs.

---

## 1. **Boolean Data Type**
- The `bool` type in Python represents boolean values: `True` and `False`.
- These values are case-sensitive and must be capitalized (`True`, `False`).
- `bool` is a subclass of `int`, with `True` equivalent to `1` and `False` equivalent to `0`.

### Example:
```python
x = True
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

print(True == 1)  # Output: True
print(False == 0)  # Output: True
```

---

## 2. **Truth Values in Python**
In Python, objects can be evaluated in a boolean context:
- **Truthy Values**: Values considered `True` in a boolean context (e.g., non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, or non-empty collections).
- **Falsy Values**: Values considered `False` in a boolean context.

### Falsy Values:
- `False`
- `None`
- Zero of any numeric type (`0`, `0.0`, `0j`)
- Empty sequences or collections (`''`, `[]`, `{}`, `set()`)

### Example:
```python
print(bool(0))       # Output: False
print(bool([]))      # Output: False
print(bool("hello"))  # Output: True
print(bool(42))      # Output: True
```

---

## 3. **Boolean Operators**
Python provides three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`.

### 3.1 `and` (Logical AND):
- Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.
- Returns the first falsy operand or the last operand if all are truthy.

#### Example:
```python
print(True and False)  # Output: False
print(5 and 10)        # Output: 10 (both are truthy, returns the second value)
print(0 and 10)        # Output: 0 (first falsy value)
```

### 3.2 `or` (Logical OR):
- Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.
- Returns the first truthy operand or the last operand if all are falsy.

#### Example:
```python
print(True or False)   # Output: True
print(0 or 10)         # Output: 10 (first truthy value)
print(0 or [])         # Output: [] (last operand, as all are falsy)
```

### 3.3 `not` (Logical NOT):
- Returns the negation of the boolean value of the operand.

#### Example:
```python
print(not True)   # Output: False
print(not 0)      # Output: True
print(not [])     # Output: True
```

---

## 4. **Precedence and Short-Circuiting**

### 4.1 Operator Precedence:
In Python, logical operators follow this precedence order:
1. `not`
2. `and`
3. `or`

#### Example:
```python
print(True or False and False)  # Output: True (and is evaluated first)
print(not True or False)        # Output: False (not is evaluated first)
```

### 4.2 Short-Circuiting:
Logical operators short-circuit, meaning they stop evaluating as soon as the result is determined:
- **`and`** stops if the first operand is `False`.
- **`or`** stops if the first operand is `True`.

#### Example:
```python
# Short-circuiting with `and`
def check_a():
    print("check_a called")
    return False

def check_b():
    print("check_b called")
    return True

print(check_a() and check_b())  # Output: check_a called, False (check_b is not called)

# Short-circuiting with `or`
print(check_a() or check_b())  # Output: check_a called, check_b called, True
```

---

## 5. **Combining Booleans with Comparisons**
Boolean values are often used with comparison operators such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 20

print(x < y and x > 5)  # Output: True
print(x == 10 or y < 15)  # Output: True
```

---

## 6. **Best Practices**
1. **Use Truthy and Falsy Values Thoughtfully:**
   - Understand what evaluates to `True` or `False` to avoid unintended behavior.

2. **Leverage Short-Circuiting:**
   - Use short-circuiting to optimize performance by skipping unnecessary computations.

3. **Use Parentheses for Clarity:**
   - Parentheses can make complex boolean expressions easier to read and maintain.
   ```python
   print((x < y) and (y > 5))
   ```

4. **Avoid Overuse of `not`:**
   - Double negatives can make code harder to understand.

---

## 7. **Conclusion**
The boolean data type is a cornerstone of logical operations and control flow in Python. By understanding boolean truth values, operator precedence, short-circuiting, and best practices, you can write clearer and more efficient Python code.

# Python Comparison Operators

Comparison operators in Python are used to compare two values and determine their relationship. These operators return boolean values (`True` or `False`) based on the outcome of the comparison.

---

## 1. **List of Comparison Operators**
Python provides the following comparison operators:

| Operator | Description                  | Example           | Output  |
|----------|------------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| `==`     | Equal to                    | `5 == 5`          | `True`  |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                | `5 != 3`          | `True`  |
| `<`      | Less than                   | `3 < 5`           | `True`  |
| `>`      | Greater than                | `5 > 3`           | `True`  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to       | `3 <= 3`          | `True`  |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to    | `5 >= 5`          | `True`  |

---

## 2. **Equality Operators (`==` and `!=`)**
- **`==`** checks if two values are equal.
- **`!=`** checks if two values are not equal.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 20

print(x == y)  # Output: False
print(x != y)  # Output: True
```

### Special Case with Objects:
When comparing objects, `==` checks for value equality, while `is` checks for identity equality.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]

print(x == y)  # Output: True (values are equal)
print(x is y)  # Output: False (different objects in memory)
```

---

## 3. **Relational Operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)**
These operators compare the relative magnitude of two values.

### Example:
```python
a = 15
b = 10

print(a > b)   # Output: True
print(a < b)   # Output: False
print(a >= b)  # Output: True
print(a <= b)  # Output: False
```

---

## 4. **Chained Comparisons**
Python allows chaining multiple comparisons, which is equivalent to using logical operators like `and`.

### Example:
```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = 15

# Chained comparison
print(x < y < z)       # Output: True (equivalent to (x < y) and (y < z))
print(x < y > z)       # Output: False
```

---

## 5. **Comparison of Different Data Types**
Python allows comparisons between some different data types, but they may yield unexpected results or raise errors.

### Examples:
#### Supported Comparisons:
```python
print(5 == 5.0)      # Output: True (int and float comparison)
print("10" == 10)    # Output: False (string vs int)
```

#### Unsupported Comparisons (Python 3):
Comparing unrelated types like strings and integers raises a `TypeError`.
```python
# Uncommenting the following line will raise an error
# print("5" > 3)
```

---

## 6. **Best Practices for Using Comparison Operators**
1. **Use `==` for Value Comparisons:**
   ```python
   print(x == y)  # Checks if values are equal
   ```

2. **Avoid Comparing Unrelated Types:**
   - Ensure operands are compatible to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.

3. **Leverage Chained Comparisons:**
   - Use chaining for concise and readable code.
   ```python
   print(0 < x < 10)  # Equivalent to (0 < x) and (x < 10)
   ```

4. **Use `is` for Identity Comparisons:**
   - Use `is` to check if two variables reference the same object.
   ```python
   print(x is y)  # True if x and y point to the same object
   ```

5. **Test Boolean Context:**
   - Use comparison results directly in conditional statements.
   ```python
   if x > y:
       print("x is greater than y")
   ```

---

## 7. **Conclusion**
Comparison operators are fundamental in Python and are used in almost every program. By understanding their behavior and leveraging features like chained comparisons, you can write more expressive and efficient code. Always ensure operands are compatible to avoid unexpected results or runtime errors.
