# Python Global and Local Scope

In Python, the scope defines the accessibility of variables. It determines where a variable can be read or modified. Understanding the difference between global and local scope is crucial for writing efficient and error-free code.

---

## 1. **What is Scope?**
Scope refers to the region of a program where a variable is defined and accessible. Python primarily has four types of scopes:
- **Local Scope**: Variables defined inside a function.
- **Global Scope**: Variables defined at the top level of a script or module.
- **Enclosing Scope**: Variables in the local scope of enclosing functions (nonlocal scope).
- **Built-in Scope**: Names preloaded into Python from the standard library (e.g., `len`, `print`).

---

## 2. **Global Scope**
Variables defined outside of all functions or classes are part of the global scope. These variables are accessible throughout the program unless shadowed by a local variable with the same name.

### Example:
```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def display():
    print(x)

display()  # Output: 10
print(x)    # Output: 10
```

### Characteristics:
1. Declared outside functions or classes.
2. Accessible anywhere in the script/module.
3. Modifiable only using the `global` keyword inside a function.

---

## 3. **Local Scope**
Variables defined inside a function are part of the local scope and are only accessible within that function.

### Example:
```python
def calculate():
    y = 5  # Local variable
    print(y)

calculate()  # Output: 5
# print(y)   # Error: NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```

### Characteristics:
1. Declared inside a function.
2. Exists only during the function execution.
3. Not accessible outside the function.

---

## 4. **Modifying Global Variables in Local Scope**
To modify a global variable inside a function, use the `global` keyword.

### Example:
```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def modify():
    global x
    x += 5

modify()
print(x)  # Output: 15
```

Without the `global` keyword, assigning a value to `x` would create a local variable instead of modifying the global one.

### Example:
```python
x = 10

def modify():
    x = 20  # Creates a new local variable

modify()
print(x)  # Output: 10 (global variable remains unchanged)
```

---

## 5. **Enclosing (Nonlocal) Scope**
When nested functions are used, variables in the enclosing function’s scope can be accessed and modified using the `nonlocal` keyword.

### Example:
```python
def outer():
    a = 10

    def inner():
        nonlocal a
        a += 5
        print("Inner a:", a)

    inner()
    print("Outer a:", a)

outer()
# Output:
# Inner a: 15
# Outer a: 15
```

---

## 6. **Built-in Scope**
The built-in scope contains predefined functions and constants provided by Python.

### Example:
```python
print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
```

### Overwriting Built-ins:
Avoid using names that shadow built-in functions.
```python
len = 10
print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # Error: 'int' object is not callable
```
To restore, delete the shadowing variable:
```python
del len
print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
```

---

## 7. **Best Practices**
1. **Minimize Use of Global Variables:**
   - Global variables can make code harder to debug and maintain.

2. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Avoid name conflicts by using meaningful variable names.

3. **Restrict Scope Where Possible:**
   - Limit variable usage to the smallest necessary scope.

4. **Avoid Shadowing Variables:**
   - Do not reuse names for global variables or built-ins inside functions.

5. **Use `global` and `nonlocal` Wisely:**
   - Only use `global` and `nonlocal` when absolutely necessary.

---

## 8. **Conclusion**
Understanding global and local scope is essential for writing clear, efficient, and maintainable Python code. By properly managing variable scope and minimizing the use of global variables, you can avoid common pitfalls and ensure better program structure.

<a id='nonlocal'></a>
# Python Nonlocal Scope

The **nonlocal scope** in Python refers to variables that are not local to the current function but exist in an enclosing function's scope. The `nonlocal` keyword allows you to access and modify such variables within nested functions.

---

## 1. **What is Nonlocal Scope?**
- Variables in the nonlocal scope reside in an **enclosing function** but are not in the global scope.
- The `nonlocal` keyword enables nested functions to modify these variables.

### Example:
```python
def outer():
    x = 10  # Nonlocal variable

    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x += 5
        print("Inner x:", x)

    inner()
    print("Outer x:", x)

outer()
# Output:
# Inner x: 15
# Outer x: 15
```

---

## 2. **Difference Between Local, Nonlocal, and Global Scope**
| Scope       | Location of Variable Definition                      | Accessibility                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Local**   | Inside the current function                          | Only within that function      |
| **Nonlocal**| In an enclosing function, not the global scope       | Accessible by nested functions |
| **Global**  | Outside all functions                                | Accessible everywhere          |

---

## 3. **Using the `nonlocal` Keyword**
The `nonlocal` keyword declares that a variable is **not local** to the current function. Without `nonlocal`, assignments create a new local variable within the nested function.

### Without `nonlocal`:
```python
def outer():
    x = 10

    def inner():
        x = 20  # Creates a new local variable, does not affect outer x
        print("Inner x:", x)

    inner()
    print("Outer x:", x)

outer()
# Output:
# Inner x: 20
# Outer x: 10
```

### With `nonlocal`:
```python
def outer():
    x = 10

    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 20  # Modifies x from the outer function
        print("Inner x:", x)

    inner()
    print("Outer x:", x)

outer()
# Output:
# Inner x: 20
# Outer x: 20
```

---

## 4. **Common Use Cases**

### 4.1 Closures
Closures often use the `nonlocal` keyword to retain and modify state across function calls.

#### Example:
```python
def counter():
    count = 0

    def increment():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count

    return increment

counter_func = counter()
print(counter_func())  # Output: 1
print(counter_func())  # Output: 2
```

### 4.2 Nested Function Logic
The `nonlocal` keyword is useful when multiple levels of nested functions require shared state.

#### Example:
```python
def outer():
    a = 5

    def inner():
        def innermost():
            nonlocal a
            a += 1
            return a

        return innermost()

    return inner()

print(outer())  # Output: 6
```

---

## 5. **Rules and Limitations**
1. **Must Be in a Nested Function:**
   - The `nonlocal` keyword works only within nested functions.

2. **Cannot Modify Global Variables:**
   - Use the `global` keyword for variables in the global scope.

3. **Raises an Error If Variable Does Not Exist:**
   - A `SyntaxError` is raised if the `nonlocal` keyword refers to a variable that does not exist in any enclosing scope.

#### Example:
```python
def func():
    def nested():
        nonlocal x  # Error: No x in enclosing scope
        x = 10
    nested()

# func()  # Uncommenting raises SyntaxError
```

---

## 6. **Best Practices**
1. **Minimize Overuse of `nonlocal`:**
   - Use sparingly to avoid making functions tightly coupled.

2. **Use Clear Variable Names:**
   - Ensure nonlocal variables are well-named to avoid confusion.

3. **Consider Alternatives:**
   - For more complex state management, consider using classes or data structures.

---

## 7. **Comparison with `global`**
| Feature          | `global`                   | `nonlocal`                 |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Scope Target     | Global variables           | Enclosing function variables |
| Where It Works   | Inside any function        | Only in nested functions    |
| Creates Variable | Yes, if it doesn't exist   | No, raises an error         |

---

## 8. **Conclusion**
The `nonlocal` keyword is a powerful tool for managing variables in nested functions. It allows for efficient state management without resorting to global variables. By understanding its usage and limitations, you can write more structured and maintainable Python code.

<a id='closure'></a>
# Python Closures

A **closure** in Python is a function object that retains access to variables from its enclosing lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are powerful tools for maintaining state and creating dynamic functions.

---

## 1. **What is a Closure?**
A closure occurs when a nested function "remembers" variables from its enclosing function, even though the enclosing function has returned.

### Key Characteristics:
1. The nested function accesses variables from the enclosing scope.
2. The enclosing function has returned, but its variables are preserved.
3. The preserved variables are part of the function’s environment.

---

## 2. **Creating a Closure**
### Example:
```python
def outer_function(value):
    def inner_function():
        return value  # Access variable from enclosing scope
    return inner_function

closure = outer_function(10)
print(closure())  # Output: 10
```

In this example:
- `inner_function` is a closure.
- The variable `value` is preserved even though `outer_function` has finished executing.

---

## 3. **Using Closures**
Closures are often used to maintain state between function calls or to customize functions dynamically.

### Example: Maintaining State
```python
def counter():
    count = 0

    def increment():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count

    return increment

counter_instance = counter()
print(counter_instance())  # Output: 1
print(counter_instance())  # Output: 2
```

In this example:
- The `increment` function retains access to `count` from the `counter` function.
- The state (`count`) is preserved across multiple calls to `counter_instance()`.

---

## 4. **Closures vs Regular Functions**
| Feature               | Regular Function                  | Closure                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Variable Access       | Access only local/global variables| Access variables from enclosing scope |
| State Persistence     | No                               | Yes                              |
| Dynamic Functionality | Limited                          | Highly customizable             |

---

## 5. **Advantages of Closures**
1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Closures allow you to encapsulate logic and state within a single function.

2. **Eliminates Global Variables:**
   - Variables from the enclosing scope act as a private storage, reducing the need for global variables.

3. **Higher-Order Functionality:**
   - Enables the creation of dynamic and reusable higher-order functions.

4. **Custom Callbacks:**
   - Commonly used for creating specialized callback functions.

---

## 6. **Real-World Use Cases**
### 6.1 Function Customization
```python
def multiplier(factor):
    def multiply_by(x):
        return x * factor
    return multiply_by

# Create specific multiplier functions
double = multiplier(2)
triple = multiplier(3)

print(double(5))  # Output: 10
print(triple(5))  # Output: 15
```

### 6.2 Logging Decorators
Closures are often used in decorators to customize behavior dynamically.
```python
def logger(msg):
    def log():
        print(f"Log: {msg}")
    return log

log_hello = logger("Hello World!")
log_hello()  # Output: Log: Hello World!
```

---

## 7. **Inspecting Closures**
Closures can be inspected to understand their preserved state.

### Example:
```python
def outer_function(value):
    def inner_function():
        return value
    return inner_function

closure_func = outer_function(42)
print(closure_func.__closure__)  # Output: (<cell at 0x...: int object at 0x...>,)

# Inspect preserved variables
print(closure_func.__closure__[0].cell_contents)  # Output: 42
```

---

## 8. **Limitations of Closures**
1. **Potential Memory Overhead:**
   - Retaining state increases memory usage.

2. **Debugging Complexity:**
   - Inspecting and debugging closures can be challenging.

3. **Limited Reusability:**
   - Closures are specific to the context in which they are created.

---

## 9. **Best Practices**
1. **Keep Closures Simple:**
   - Avoid overly complex logic inside closures.

2. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Name inner functions meaningfully to convey their purpose.

3. **Document Closures:**
   - Clearly document the role and behavior of closures for maintainability.

4. **Consider Alternatives:**
   - For extensive state management, consider using classes or data structures instead.

---

## 10. **Conclusion**
Closures are a powerful feature in Python for creating functions with retained state and encapsulated behavior. By understanding their structure and use cases, you can leverage closures to write concise, dynamic, and efficient code. Use them judiciously to maintain code readability and performance.

<a id='decorator'></a>
# Python Decorators

Decorators in Python are a powerful tool for modifying or enhancing the behavior of functions or methods without permanently changing their source code. They are commonly used for logging, access control, caching, and more.

---

## 1. **What is a Decorator?**
A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, extends or alters its behavior, and returns a new function or the original one with modified behavior.

### Basic Syntax:
```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        # Modify or extend behavior here
        return func()
    return wrapper

@decorator  # This is equivalent to: func = decorator(func)
def func():
    print("Original function")

func()  # Output depends on the decorator logic
```

---

## 2. **Creating and Using Decorators**

### Example 1: Simple Decorator
```python
def simple_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function call")
        func()
        print("After the function call")
    return wrapper

@simple_decorator
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

greet()
# Output:
# Before the function call
# Hello, World!
# After the function call
```

### Example 2: Decorator with Arguments
```python
def decorator_with_args(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Function called with: args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@decorator_with_args
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(f"Result: {result}")
# Output:
# Function called with: args=(3, 5), kwargs={}
# Result: 8
```

---

## 3. **Decorators with Parameters**
Decorators themselves can accept arguments by nesting additional functions.

### Example:
```python
def repeat(times):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(times):
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@repeat(3)
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
# Output:
# Hello!
# Hello!
# Hello!
```

---

## 4. **Built-in Decorators**
Python provides several built-in decorators for specific use cases:

### 4.1 `@staticmethod`
Defines a method that does not operate on an instance or class.
```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def greet():
        print("Hello from static method")

MyClass.greet()  # Output: Hello from static method
```

### 4.2 `@classmethod`
Defines a method that operates on the class, not the instance.
```python
class MyClass:
    count = 0

    @classmethod
    def increment(cls):
        cls.count += 1

MyClass.increment()
print(MyClass.count)  # Output: 1
```

### 4.3 `@property`
Creates getter, setter, and deleter methods for attributes.
```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, value):
        if value <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Radius must be positive")
        self._radius = value

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.radius)  # Output: 5
circle.radius = 10
print(circle.radius)  # Output: 10
```

---

## 5. **Multiple Decorators**
Decorators can be stacked by applying them one after the other.

### Example:
```python
def decorator1(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Decorator 1")
        func()
    return wrapper

def decorator2(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Decorator 2")
        func()
    return wrapper

@decorator1
@decorator2
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
# Output:
# Decorator 1
# Decorator 2
# Hello!
```

---

## 6. **Preserving Metadata with `functools.wraps`**
When a decorator wraps a function, it can obscure the original function's metadata (e.g., name, docstring). Use `functools.wraps` to preserve this information.

### Example:
```python
from functools import wraps

def decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Calling decorated function")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@decorator
def greet():
    """This function greets the user."""
    print("Hello!")

print(greet.__name__)  # Output: greet
print(greet.__doc__)   # Output: This function greets the user.
```

---

## 7. **Real-World Applications**
1. **Logging:**
   ```python
   def log(func):
       def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
           print(f"Function {func.__name__} called with arguments {args} and {kwargs}")
           return func(*args, **kwargs)
       return wrapper
   ```

2. **Access Control:**
   ```python
   def requires_admin(func):
       def wrapper(user, *args, **kwargs):
           if user != "admin":
               raise PermissionError("Admin privileges required")
           return func(user, *args, **kwargs)
       return wrapper
   ```

3. **Caching:**
   ```python
   from functools import lru_cache

   @lru_cache(maxsize=32)
   def fibonacci(n):
       if n < 2:
           return n
       return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
   ```

---

## 8. **Best Practices**
1. **Use `@wraps` to Preserve Metadata:**
   - Always wrap your decorated functions with `functools.wraps`.

2. **Limit Complexity:**
   - Avoid creating overly complex decorators; keep them focused on a single task.

3. **Document Decorators:**
   - Provide clear documentation for custom decorators.

---

## 9. **Conclusion**
Decorators are a versatile and powerful feature in Python, enabling modular and reusable enhancements to functions or methods. By understanding their structure and use cases, you can implement them effectively to improve code functionality and maintainability.
