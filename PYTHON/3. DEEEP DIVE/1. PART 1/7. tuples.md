# Python Tuples

Tuples in Python are immutable, ordered collections of items. They are similar to lists but have the added property of immutability, which makes them hashable and suitable for use as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.

---

## 1. **Defining Tuples**
Tuples are defined by enclosing items in parentheses `()` and separating them with commas.

### Example:
```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = ("a", "b", "c")
print(tuple1)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)
print(tuple2)  # Output: ('a', 'b', 'c')
```

- **Single-Element Tuples:** A trailing comma is required for single-element tuples.
```python
tuple1 = (5,)  # Correct
tuple2 = (5)   # Incorrect, this is an integer
```

- **Empty Tuple:**
```python
empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)  # Output: ()
```

---

## 2. **Characteristics of Tuples**
1. **Immutable:**
   - Once created, the items in a tuple cannot be modified.

2. **Ordered:**
   - The order of elements in a tuple is preserved.

3. **Allow Duplicates:**
   - Tuples can contain duplicate elements.

4. **Can Store Mixed Data Types:**
   - A tuple can hold elements of different types.

### Example:
```python
mixed_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14, True)
print(mixed_tuple)  # Output: (1, 'hello', 3.14, True)
```

---

## 3. **Accessing Tuple Elements**

### Indexing:
```python
tuple1 = (10, 20, 30)
print(tuple1[0])  # Output: 10
print(tuple1[-1]) # Output: 30
```

### Slicing:
```python
tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(tuple1[1:4])  # Output: (20, 30, 40)
```

---

## 4. **Tuple Operations**

### Concatenation:
```python
tuple1 = (1, 2)
tuple2 = (3, 4)
result = tuple1 + tuple2
print(result)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

### Repetition:
```python
tuple1 = ("a", "b")
result = tuple1 * 3
print(result)  # Output: ('a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b')
```

### Membership Testing:
```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
print(2 in tuple1)  # Output: True
print(5 in tuple1)  # Output: False
```

### Iteration:
```python
tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for item in tuple1:
    print(item)
```

---

## 5. **Tuple Methods**
Tuples have two built-in methods:

### 5.1 `count()`
Returns the number of occurrences of a specific value.
```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 2, 3)
print(tuple1.count(2))  # Output: 2
```

### 5.2 `index()`
Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value.
```python
tuple1 = (10, 20, 30)
print(tuple1.index(20))  # Output: 1
```

---

## 6. **Immutability and Its Implications**
Since tuples are immutable:
1. **Elements Cannot Be Changed:**
   ```python
   tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
   # tuple1[0] = 10  # Error: TypeError
   ```

2. **Tuples Are Hashable:**
   - Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries.
   ```python
   dictionary = { (1, 2): "value" }
   print(dictionary[(1, 2)])  # Output: value
   ```

3. **Nested Mutability:**
   - Tuples can contain mutable objects (e.g., lists), but the tuple itself remains immutable.
   ```python
   tuple1 = ([1, 2], 3)
   tuple1[0].append(4)  # This modifies the list inside the tuple
   print(tuple1)         # Output: ([1, 2, 4], 3)
   ```

---

## 7. **Advantages of Tuples**
1. **Performance:**
   - Tuples are generally faster than lists for read-only operations.

2. **Safety:**
   - Immutability makes them safer to use in scenarios where data integrity is important.

3. **Hashability:**
   - Can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.

---

## 8. **Applications of Tuples**
1. **Returning Multiple Values:**
   ```python
   def get_coordinates():
       return (10, 20)

   x, y = get_coordinates()
   print(x, y)  # Output: 10 20
   ```

2. **Unpacking:**
   ```python
   tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
   a, b, c = tuple1
   print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3
   ```

3. **Immutable Data Storage:**
   - Useful for constants or fixed collections of items.

---

## 9. **Best Practices**
1. Use tuples for data that should not change during the program's execution.
2. Prefer lists over tuples if the data needs to be modified frequently.
3. Use descriptive variable names when unpacking tuples to improve code readability.

---

## 10. **Conclusion**
Tuples are a versatile and efficient data structure in Python. Their immutability, combined with their simplicity, makes them an excellent choice for storing fixed collections of related data. Understanding tuples and their properties will help you write more robust and efficient Python code.

# Python Named Tuples

Named tuples in Python are a subclass of the built-in `tuple` data type. They provide a way to access tuple elements by name, making the code more readable and self-documenting.

---

## 1. **What is a Named Tuple?**
A named tuple is a tuple-like object that has fields accessible by both index and name. Named tuples are created using the `collections.namedtuple` factory function.

### Syntax:
```python
from collections import namedtuple

NamedTupleClass = namedtuple("Name", ["field1", "field2", ...])
```

---

## 2. **Creating a Named Tuple**

### Example:
```python
from collections import namedtuple

# Define a named tuple
Point = namedtuple("Point", ["x", "y"])

# Create an instance
p = Point(10, 20)

print(p)           # Output: Point(x=10, y=20)
print(p.x, p.y)    # Output: 10 20
```

### Characteristics:
1. **Access by Field Name:**
   - Access elements using dot notation (e.g., `p.x`).
2. **Access by Index:**
   - Named tuples retain tuple-like behavior and can be accessed by index.
   ```python
   print(p[0], p[1])  # Output: 10 20
   ```

---

## 3. **Methods of Named Tuples**
Named tuples provide additional methods compared to regular tuples:

### 3.1 `_fields`
Returns a tuple of field names.
```python
print(Point._fields)  # Output: ('x', 'y')
```

### 3.2 `_make(iterable)`
Creates a named tuple instance from an iterable.
```python
data = [30, 40]
p = Point._make(data)
print(p)  # Output: Point(x=30, y=40)
```

### 3.3 `_asdict()`
Returns an `OrderedDict` representation of the named tuple.
```python
print(p._asdict())  # Output: {'x': 30, 'y': 40}
```

### 3.4 `_replace(**kwargs)`
Returns a new named tuple instance with specified fields replaced.
```python
p_new = p._replace(x=50)
print(p_new)  # Output: Point(x=50, y=40)
```

---

## 4. **Advantages of Named Tuples**
1. **Readability:**
   - Field names make code more self-explanatory compared to accessing by index.

2. **Immutability:**
   - Like regular tuples, named tuples are immutable, ensuring data integrity.

3. **Compactness:**
   - They use less memory compared to dictionaries.

4. **Compatibility with Tuples:**
   - Can be used wherever a tuple is expected.

---

## 5. **Use Cases**

### 5.1 Representing Fixed Data Structures
Named tuples are ideal for scenarios with structured, unchanging data.
```python
Rectangle = namedtuple("Rectangle", ["width", "height"])
r = Rectangle(10, 20)
print(r.width * r.height)  # Output: 200
```

### 5.2 Replacing Dictionaries for Simple Data
Named tuples are a lightweight alternative to dictionaries for small datasets.
```python
# Using a dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice

# Using a named tuple
Person = namedtuple("Person", ["name", "age"])
alice = Person("Alice", 30)
print(alice.name)  # Output: Alice
```

### 5.3 Structured Data in Iterables
Named tuples work well with iterables like lists and data from databases or CSV files.
```python
rows = [("Alice", 30), ("Bob", 25)]
Person = namedtuple("Person", ["name", "age"])
people = [Person._make(row) for row in rows]

for person in people:
    print(f"{person.name} is {person.age} years old.")
```

---

## 6. **Named Tuples in Python 3.6+ (`typing.NamedTuple`)**
Python 3.6 introduced `typing.NamedTuple`, which provides a more class-like syntax for defining named tuples.

### Example:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Point(NamedTuple):
    x: int
    y: int

p = Point(10, 20)
print(p)        # Output: Point(x=10, y=20)
print(p.x)      # Output: 10
```

### Advantages:
- Enables type hints.
- Supports default values for fields.

### Example with Default Values:
```python
class Rectangle(NamedTuple):
    width: int
    height: int = 10

r = Rectangle(20)
print(r)  # Output: Rectangle(width=20, height=10)
```

---

## 7. **Limitations of Named Tuples**
1. **Immutability:**
   - Like regular tuples, named tuples are immutable and cannot be modified after creation.

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - While more memory-efficient than dictionaries, named tuples are less flexible.

3. **Complex Structures:**
   - For deeply nested or complex data, classes may be more appropriate.

---

## 8. **Best Practices**
1. Use named tuples for simple, structured, and immutable data.
2. For more complex data or when behavior (methods) is required, use classes.
3. Use `typing.NamedTuple` for enhanced readability and type annotations.

---

## 9. **Conclusion**
Named tuples offer a convenient and readable way to handle structured data in Python. They combine the simplicity of tuples with the expressiveness of field names, making them a versatile choice for many programming scenarios. By understanding their methods and use cases, you can write cleaner and more efficient code.
