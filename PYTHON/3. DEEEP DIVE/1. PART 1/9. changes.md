     ```python
     name: str = "Alice"
     age: int
     ```

3. **Underscores in Numeric Literals:**
   - Improves readability of large numbers.
   - Example:
     ```python
     million = 1_000_000
     ```

4. **`secrets` Module:**
   - Provides secure random numbers for cryptographic purposes.

## Python 3.7 (Released: June 27, 2018)
### Key Features:
1. **Data Classes:**
   - Simplifies the creation of classes used to store data.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from dataclasses import dataclass

     @dataclass
     class Point:
         x: int
         y: int
     ```

2. **`async` and `await` as Reserved Keywords:**
   - Solidifies support for asynchronous programming.

3. **Time Resolution:**
   - Improved precision for time-related functions (nanoseconds).

4. **`breakpoint()` Built-in Function:**
   - Simplifies debugging by automatically integrating with debuggers.

## Python 3.8 (Released: October 14, 2019)
### Key Features:
1. **Assignment Expressions (Walrus Operator `:=`):**
   - Enables assignment inside expressions.
   - Example:
     ```python
     if (n := len(items)) > 0:
         print(f"Number of items: {n}")
     ```

2. **Positional-only Parameters:**
   - Adds support for parameters that must be passed by position.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def greet(name, /, greeting):
         print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")
     ```

3. **Reversed Dictionary Iteration:**
   - Support for reverse iteration of dictionaries.

4. **New `typing` Features:**
   - Introduced `Literal` for stricter type hinting.

## Python 3.9 (Released: October 5, 2020)
### Key Features:
1. **Dictionary Union Operators:**
   - Simplifies merging dictionaries with `|` and `|=`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     d1 = {"a": 1}
     d2 = {"b": 2}
     merged = d1 | d2
     ```

2. **Type Hinting Improvements:**
   - Generic types can now be used directly (e.g., `list[int]` instead of `List[int]`).

3. **New String Methods:**
   - `.removeprefix()` and `.removesuffix()`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     "unwanted_prefix_text".removeprefix("unwanted_")
     ```

4. **ZoneInfo Module:**
   - Native support for time zones.

## Python 3.10 (Released: October 4, 2021)
### Key Features:
1. **Pattern Matching:**
   - Adds `match` and `case` for structural pattern matching.
   - Example:
     ```python
     match command:
         case "start":
             print("Starting...")
         case "stop":
             print("Stopping...")
     ```

2. **Parenthesized Context Managers:**
   - Allows better readability with multiple context managers.
   - Example:
     ```python
     with (open("file1.txt") as f1,
           open("file2.txt") as f2):
         pass
     ```

3. **Better Error Messages:**
   - Enhanced error messages for syntax and indentation issues.

4. **Precise Types:**
   - Added `typing.TypeAlias` for declaring type aliases.

## Python 3.11 (Released: October 24, 2022)
### Key Features:
1. **Exception Groups:**
   - Handle multiple exceptions using `ExceptionGroup`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     try:
         raise ExceptionGroup("group", [ValueError("error1"), TypeError("error2")])
     except ExceptionGroup as eg:
         print(eg)
     ```

2. **Faster Python:**
   - Significant performance improvements through the Faster CPython initiative.

3. **Improved `typing`:**
   - Added `Self` type for better method chaining.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Node:
         def set_next(self, next: Self) -> Self:
             self.next = next
             return self
     ```

4. **`tomllib` Module:**
   - Built-in support for reading TOML files.

## Python 3.12 (Released: October 2, 2023)
### Key Features:
1. **Performance Boosts:**
   - Further optimizations in the Faster CPython project.

2. **Expanded F-String Support:**
   - F-strings now support `=` for better debugging.
   - Example:
     ```python
     value = 42
     print(f"{value = }")  # Output: value = 42
     ```

3. **Buffer Protocol Support:**
   - Simplifies working with buffer-like objects.

4. **Improved Error Locations:**
   - More precise error reporting for syntax errors.
