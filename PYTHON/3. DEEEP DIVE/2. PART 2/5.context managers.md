# Context Managers in Python

Context managers in Python are constructs that allow you to manage resources efficiently by encapsulating setup and teardown logic. They ensure proper resource handling, such as closing files, releasing locks, or managing database connections, even in the presence of errors.

---

## 1. **What is a Context Manager?**
- A **context manager** handles resource management automatically.
- It is typically used with the `with` statement.
- Guarantees that resources are cleaned up after use, reducing the risk of resource leaks.

### Syntax:
```python
with context_manager_expression as variable:
    # Code block
```

---

## 2. **Built-in Context Managers**
Python provides several built-in context managers for common tasks.

### 2.1 File Handling
Automatically handles file opening and closing.
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
print(content)  # File is closed automatically
```

### 2.2 Thread Locks
Manages locks in multithreaded programs.
```python
import threading
lock = threading.Lock()

with lock:
    # Critical section
    print("Lock acquired")
```

### 2.3 Temporary Files
```python
import tempfile

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True) as temp_file:
    temp_file.write(b"Temporary content")
    print(temp_file.name)  # Automatically deleted after use
```

---

## 3. **Custom Context Managers**
You can create custom context managers to handle specific resources.

### 3.1 Using Classes
To create a custom context manager using a class, define `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods.

#### Example:
```python
class CustomContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting context")

# Usage
with CustomContextManager() as manager:
    print("Inside context")
```
**Output:**
```
Entering context
Inside context
Exiting context
```

### 3.2 Using `contextlib` Module
The `contextlib` module provides a more concise way to create context managers using decorators.

#### Example:
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def custom_context():
    print("Entering context")
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        print("Exiting context")

# Usage
with custom_context():
    print("Inside context")
```
**Output:**
```
Entering context
Inside context
Exiting context
```

---

## 4. **Error Handling in Context Managers**
Context managers can handle exceptions raised within the `with` block using the `__exit__()` method.

### Example:
```python
class SafeContext:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type:
            print(f"Exception handled: {exc_value}")
        print("Exiting context")
        return True  # Suppresses the exception

# Usage
with SafeContext() as manager:
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong")

print("Code continues...")
```
**Output:**
```
Entering context
Exception handled: Something went wrong
Exiting context
Code continues...
```

---

## 5. **Best Practices**
1. **Prefer `with` Statement:**
   - Always use `with` for resources like files, locks, and network connections.

2. **Use `contextlib` for Simplicity:**
   - The `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator simplifies custom context managers.

3. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully:**
   - Design context managers to handle exceptions without disrupting program flow.

4. **Test Custom Context Managers Thoroughly:**
   - Ensure proper cleanup occurs in all scenarios, including exceptions.

---

## 6. **Common Use Cases**

### 6.1 Database Connections
```python
import sqlite3

@contextmanager
def database_connection(db_name):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        conn.close()

with database_connection("example.db") as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)")
```

### 6.2 Timing Code Execution
```python
import time

@contextmanager
def timer():
    start = time.time()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed time: {end - start:.2f} seconds")

with timer():
    time.sleep(2)
```
**Output:**
```
Elapsed time: 2.00 seconds
```

---

## 7. **Limitations of Context Managers**
1. **One Resource at a Time:**
   - Each `with` statement manages a single context. Use nested `with` statements for multiple contexts.

2. **Complex Cleanup Logic:**
   - Custom context managers with complex cleanup logic may require careful design to avoid errors.

3. **Memory Overhead:**
   - Improper implementation of custom context managers may lead to memory leaks.

---

## 8. **Conclusion**
Context managers are a vital feature in Python for efficient resource management. Whether using built-in tools, `contextlib`, or custom implementations, they ensure cleaner, safer, and more maintainable code. By understanding their structure and capabilities, you can simplify resource-intensive operations and improve error handling in your applications.

<a id='caveat'></a>
# Caveats with Lazy Iterators in Context Managers

Lazy iterators are a powerful feature in Python that generate values on demand, conserving memory. However, when used within context managers, they introduce unique challenges and pitfalls that developers need to be aware of to avoid unexpected behavior.

---

## 1. **What Are Lazy Iterators?**
- **Definition:** Lazy iterators generate values one at a time as they are requested, rather than precomputing all values and storing them in memory.
- Examples of lazy iterators include generators, `itertools` tools, and custom iterator classes.

---

## 2. **Context Managers and Iterators**
- Context managers are often used to manage resources like files, network connections, or database connections.
- When a lazy iterator depends on a resource managed by a context manager, there is a risk of accessing the iterator after the resource is closed.

---

## 3. **Common Caveats**

### 3.1 Iterator Exhaustion After Context Exit
Lazy iterators relying on a resource inside a `with` block become invalid after the context exits.

#### Example:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = (line.strip() for line in file)

# Trying to iterate after the context has exited
for line in lines:
    print(line)  # Raises ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.
```
**Why?** The file is closed when the `with` block ends, making the generator unusable.

#### Solution:
Consume the iterator completely within the `with` block or store its results.
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = [line.strip() for line in file]

# Safe to iterate
for line in lines:
    print(line)
```

---

### 3.2 Deferred Execution
Lazy iterators delay computation until explicitly requested. If they depend on a resource managed by a context manager, execution may fail if the resource is no longer available.

#### Example:
```python
import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect("example.db") as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    data = (row for row in cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users"))

# Attempt to consume data
for row in data:
    print(row)  # Raises sqlite3.ProgrammingError: Cannot operate on a closed database.
```

#### Solution:
Consume the iterator before the resource is closed:
```python
with sqlite3.connect("example.db") as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    data = list(cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users"))

# Safe to iterate
for row in data:
    print(row)
```

---

### 3.3 Combining with Nested Contexts
Lazy iterators can inadvertently span multiple contexts, leading to unpredictable behavior when resources are closed out of order.

#### Example:
```python
from itertools import chain

def file_lines(file_name):
    with open(file_name, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]
all_lines = chain(*(file_lines(f) for f in files))

for line in all_lines:
    print(line)  # May raise ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.
```

#### Solution:
Manage the context explicitly within the generator:
```python
from itertools import chain

def file_lines(file_name):
    with open(file_name, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]

# Consume fully within the context of each file
all_lines = chain(*(list(file_lines(f)) for f in files))

for line in all_lines:
    print(line)
```

---

## 4. **Best Practices**
1. **Consume Iterators Early:**
   - Fully consume lazy iterators inside the context manager to ensure resource availability.

2. **Store Results:**
   - If data needs to be used outside the context, store it in a list or another collection before exiting the `with` block.

3. **Avoid Nesting Generators Across Contexts:**
   - Ensure that lazy iterators do not span multiple context managers unless carefully managed.

4. **Combine with `contextlib`:**
   - Use `contextlib` utilities like `closing()` to ensure proper cleanup of resources.

#### Example:
```python
from contextlib import closing
import sqlite3

with closing(sqlite3.connect("example.db")) as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    data = (row for row in cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users"))
    rows = list(data)  # Consume iterator safely

for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

---

## 5. **Common Pitfalls**
1. **Using Lazy Iterators Outside Context:**
   - Ensure all dependencies are valid when consuming lazy iterators.

2. **Memory Overhead from Storing Results:**
   - If iterators produce large datasets, storing results may cause high memory usage. Consider using chunked processing instead.

3. **Debugging Deferred Execution:**
   - Errors in lazy iterators may appear far from their origin. Test logic thoroughly within the context manager.

---

## 6. **Conclusion**
Lazy iterators are a powerful feature in Python, but their interaction with context managers requires careful attention. By consuming iterators within the context, storing results, and avoiding deferred execution outside the resource's lifecycle, you can prevent common pitfalls and ensure robust, efficient code.

# Additional Uses of Context Managers in Python

Context managers in Python are best known for resource management, such as handling files or database connections. However, their versatility allows them to be applied to a wide range of scenarios beyond resource cleanup. This document explores additional and creative uses of context managers.

---

## 1. **Timing Code Execution**

Context managers can measure the time taken to execute a block of code.

### Example:
```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.end = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed time: {self.end - self.start:.2f} seconds")

with Timer():
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a long task
```
**Output:**
```
Elapsed time: 2.00 seconds
```

---

## 2. **Debugging and Logging**

Context managers can track the flow of code, log messages, or debug specific sections.

### Example:
```python
class DebugContext:
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"DEBUG: Starting - {self.message}")

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print(f"DEBUG: Ending - {self.message}")

with DebugContext("Critical Section"):
    x = [i**2 for i in range(10)]
    print("Processing done.")
```
**Output:**
```
DEBUG: Starting - Critical Section
Processing done.
DEBUG: Ending - Critical Section
```

---

## 3. **Setting Temporary Environment Variables**

Context managers can temporarily modify environment variables, ensuring changes are reverted after use.

### Example:
```python
import os
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def temporary_env(var, value):
    original = os.environ.get(var)
    os.environ[var] = value
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        if original is None:
            del os.environ[var]
        else:
            os.environ[var] = original

with temporary_env("MY_VAR", "temporary_value"):
    print(os.environ.get("MY_VAR"))  # Output: temporary_value

print(os.environ.get("MY_VAR"))  # Output: None
```

---

## 4. **Mocking and Testing**

During testing, context managers can mock objects or simulate environments temporarily.

### Example:
```python
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch("os.path.exists", return_value=True)
def test_mocked_path(mock_exists):
    with patch("os.getenv", return_value="test_env"):
        assert os.path.exists("some_path") is True
        assert os.getenv("MY_VAR") == "test_env"

test_mocked_path()
```

---

## 5. **Profiling Memory Usage**

Context managers can monitor memory usage during the execution of a code block.

### Example:
```python
from memory_profiler import memory_usage

class MemoryProfiler:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_mem = memory_usage()[0]
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.end_mem = memory_usage()[0]
        print(f"Memory used: {self.end_mem - self.start_mem} MB")

with MemoryProfiler():
    large_list = [i for i in range(10**6)]
```

---

## 6. **Resource Pooling**

Context managers can manage resource pools, such as database connections or thread pools.

### Example:
```python
from queue import Queue

class ResourcePool:
    def __init__(self, resources):
        self.pool = Queue()
        for resource in resources:
            self.pool.put(resource)

    def __enter__(self):
        return self.pool.get()

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.pool.task_done()

resources = ["db_conn1", "db_conn2", "db_conn3"]
resource_pool = ResourcePool(resources)

with resource_pool as resource:
    print(f"Using resource: {resource}")
```
**Output:**
```
Using resource: db_conn1
```

---

## 7. **Temporary Redirecting of Standard Output**

Redirect standard output or error streams temporarily using context managers.

### Example:
```python
import sys
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def redirect_stdout(new_output):
    original_stdout = sys.stdout
    sys.stdout = new_output
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

with open("output.log", "w") as f, redirect_stdout(f):
    print("This will be written to the file")
```

---

## 8. **Custom Assertions for Validation**

Context managers can assert conditions, raising exceptions if conditions are not met.

### Example:
```python
class AssertCondition:
    def __init__(self, condition, message):
        self.condition = condition
        self.message = message

    def __enter__(self):
        if not self.condition:
            raise AssertionError(self.message)

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        pass

with AssertCondition(2 + 2 == 4, "Math is broken"):
    print("Assertion passed.")
```
**Output:**
```
Assertion passed.
```

---

## 9. **Best Practices for Advanced Uses**
1. **Keep Contexts Lightweight:**
   - Avoid heavy operations in `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
2. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully:**
   - Ensure proper resource cleanup, even in case of errors.
3. **Combine with Decorators:**
   - Use context managers as decorators for reusable logic.

---

## 10. **Conclusion**
Context managers extend far beyond resource cleanup, offering solutions for timing, testing, mocking, validation, and more. By leveraging their flexibility, you can simplify and enhance many aspects of Python programming while ensuring robustness and maintainability.
<a id='generators'></a>
# Generators and Context Managers in Python

Generators and context managers are two powerful constructs in Python. When used together, they allow for resource management within lazy iterable constructs. This combination is particularly effective for managing resources like files, network connections, or database cursors in a memory-efficient way.

---

## 1. **What are Generators and Context Managers?**

### Generators:
- Generators are iterators that produce items lazily using the `yield` keyword.
- They are memory-efficient, as they do not store the entire sequence in memory.

### Context Managers:
- Context managers manage resources, ensuring setup and cleanup actions are performed automatically using the `with` statement.
- Commonly used to manage files, database connections, and locks.

---

## 2. **Combining Generators and Context Managers**

### Why Combine Them?
- Generators are ideal for processing data lazily, while context managers ensure resource cleanup.
- Combining them allows efficient iteration over resources without leaving them open indefinitely.

### Example:
```python
def read_file_in_chunks(file_path, chunk_size=1024):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        while chunk := file.read(chunk_size):
            yield chunk

# Usage
for chunk in read_file_in_chunks("example.txt"):
    print(chunk)
```
**Explanation:**
- The generator reads the file lazily in chunks.
- The `with` statement ensures the file is closed when the iteration is complete.

---

## 3. **Using `contextlib.contextmanager`**
The `contextlib` module provides a decorator, `contextmanager`, that simplifies writing context managers using generator syntax.

### Syntax:
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def context_manager_name():
    # Setup
    yield resource
    # Teardown
```

### Example:
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def open_file(file_path, mode):
    file = open(file_path, mode)
    try:
        yield file
    finally:
        file.close()

# Usage
with open_file("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)
```
**Explanation:**
- `contextmanager` converts a generator into a context manager.
- The `yield` statement separates the setup (`open`) and teardown (`close`) logic.

---

## 4. **Building Reusable Generators with Context Management**

### Example: Processing a Database Connection
```python
import sqlite3
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def database_connection(db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        conn.close()

def query_data(db_path, query):
    with database_connection(db_path) as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        for row in cursor.execute(query):
            yield row

# Usage
for row in query_data("example.db", "SELECT * FROM users"):
    print(row)
```
**Explanation:**
- The `database_connection` context manager manages the lifecycle of the database connection.
- The generator `query_data` allows lazy iteration over query results.

---

## 5. **Common Patterns**

### 5.1 Wrapping Multiple Resources
You can manage multiple resources in a generator using context managers.

#### Example:
```python
from contextlib import ExitStack

def process_files(*file_paths):
    with ExitStack() as stack:
        files = [stack.enter_context(open(file, 'r')) for file in file_paths]
        for lines in zip(*files):
            yield lines

# Usage
for lines in process_files("file1.txt", "file2.txt"):
    print(lines)
```
**Explanation:**
- `ExitStack` dynamically manages multiple context managers.
- The generator lazily processes lines from multiple files simultaneously.

### 5.2 Managing Network Connections
```python
import requests
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def fetch_url(url):
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    try:
        yield response
    finally:
        response.close()

def fetch_lines(url):
    with fetch_url(url) as response:
        for line in response.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
            yield line

# Usage
for line in fetch_lines("https://example.com/data.txt"):
    print(line)
```

---

## 6. **Caveats and Best Practices**

### 6.1 Avoid Using Open Resources Outside the Generator
- Resources managed by context managers should not be accessed outside the generator.

#### Example of a Problem:
```python
def bad_generator():
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    yield from file
    # File is not closed properly

for line in bad_generator():
    print(line)
# File remains open!
```

### 6.2 Proper Cleanup with `finally` or Context Managers
Always ensure resources are cleaned up, even if an error occurs during iteration.

---

## 7. **Comparison: Generators vs Context Managers**

| Feature                   | Generators                             | Context Managers                       |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**               | Lazy iteration                        | Resource management                    |
| **Setup and Teardown**    | Implicit during iteration              | Explicit with `__enter__`/`__exit__`   |
| **Combining**             | Yield values one at a time            | Manage resources while yielding values |
| **Use Case**              | Processing streams of data            | Managing files, locks, connections     |

---

## 8. **Conclusion**
Generators and context managers complement each other in Python. While generators handle lazy iteration, context managers ensure that resources are properly managed. By combining these constructs, you can build efficient, readable, and safe code for a variety of real-world applications, from file processing to database queries and network requests.

<a id='decorator'></a>
# Context Manager Decorator in Python

The `@contextmanager` decorator, provided by the `contextlib` module, simplifies the process of creating context managers. Instead of defining a class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, you can use a generator function with `yield` to separate the setup and teardown logic.

---

## 1. **What is the Context Manager Decorator?**
- A decorator that transforms a generator function into a context manager.
- Handles resource setup and cleanup in a concise and readable manner.
- Ideal for simple use cases where creating a class-based context manager would be overkill.

---

## 2. **How to Use the `@contextmanager` Decorator?**

### Syntax:
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def context_manager_name():
    # Setup code
    yield resource
    # Teardown code
```

### Key Points:
1. Code before `yield` handles **setup**.
2. Code after `yield` handles **teardown**.
3. `yield` can optionally return a resource to the `with` block.

---

## 3. **Basic Example**

### File Handling:
A custom context manager for file handling.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def open_file(file_path, mode):
    file = open(file_path, mode)
    try:
        yield file
    finally:
        file.close()

# Usage
with open_file("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
# File is automatically closed
```
**Explanation:**
- The file is opened before the `yield`.
- After the `with` block, the file is closed automatically, even if an exception occurs.

---

## 4. **Advanced Examples**

### 4.1 Database Connections
Manage database connections efficiently.
```python
import sqlite3
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def database_connection(db_name):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        conn.close()

# Usage
with database_connection("example.db") as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)")
```

### 4.2 Redirecting Output
Temporarily redirect standard output.
```python
import sys
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def redirect_stdout(new_output):
    original_stdout = sys.stdout
    sys.stdout = new_output
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

# Usage
with open("output.log", "w") as file, redirect_stdout(file):
    print("This will be written to the file")
```

### 4.3 Timing Code Execution
Measure the execution time of a code block.
```python
import time
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def timer():
    start = time.time()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed time: {end - start:.2f} seconds")

# Usage
with timer():
    time.sleep(2)
```
**Output:**
```
Elapsed time: 2.00 seconds
```

---

## 5. **Error Handling in Context Manager Decorators**
The `@contextmanager` decorator automatically propagates exceptions. You can handle or suppress exceptions within the teardown section if needed.

### Example:
```python
@contextmanager
def suppress_exceptions():
    try:
        yield
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception suppressed: {e}")

# Usage
with suppress_exceptions():
    raise ValueError("An error occurred")
```
**Output:**
```
Exception suppressed: An error occurred
```

---

## 6. **Best Practices**
1. **Keep it Simple:**
   - Use the `@contextmanager` decorator for straightforward use cases.

2. **Handle Resources Properly:**
   - Always ensure cleanup logic runs in the `finally` block.

3. **Avoid Complex Logic:**
   - For complex resource management, consider using a class-based context manager.

4. **Combine with Generators:**
   - Use `@contextmanager` for generators requiring resource management.

## 7. **Comparison: Class-Based vs. Decorator-Based Context Managers**

| Feature                | Class-Based Context Manager       | Decorator-Based Context Manager |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Setup/Teardown**     | `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods | Code before/after `yield`      |
| **Code Complexity**    | More verbose                     | Concise and readable           |
| **Use Case**           | Complex resource management       | Simple scenarios               |

---

## 8. **Common Pitfalls**
1. **Missing Teardown Code:**
   - Forgetting to include cleanup logic after `yield` can lead to resource leaks.

2. **Raising Exceptions in Setup:**
   - Exceptions in the setup code prevent the teardown code from running.

3. **Using Outside `with` Block:**
   - Resources yielded by the context manager should not be used outside the `with` block.

---

## 9. **Conclusion**
The `@contextmanager` decorator is a powerful tool for creating simple and efficient context managers in Python. It reduces boilerplate code while maintaining clarity and robustness. By leveraging this decorator, developers can manage resources effectively in a wide range of scenarios.

# Nested Context Managers in Python

Nested context managers allow you to manage multiple resources simultaneously. They are often used when multiple resources need to be opened, managed, or processed together. Python provides straightforward ways to handle nested context managers, making your code clean and efficient.

---

## 1. **What are Nested Context Managers?**
- **Definition:** Using multiple `with` statements to manage multiple resources in the same block.
- Ensures that all resources are properly set up and cleaned up in a specific order.
- Handles exceptions gracefully for each resource.

---

## 2. **Basic Syntax**
### Using Separate `with` Statements:
```python
with context_manager_1 as resource_1:
    with context_manager_2 as resource_2:
        # Work with resource_1 and resource_2
```

### Using a Single `with` Statement:
```python
with context_manager_1 as resource_1, context_manager_2 as resource_2:
    # Work with resource_1 and resource_2
```

---

## 3. **Examples of Nested Context Managers**

### 3.1 Managing Multiple Files
When reading or writing to multiple files, nested context managers ensure that all files are properly closed.

#### Example:
```python
# Using separate `with` statements
with open("file1.txt", "r") as file1:
    with open("file2.txt", "r") as file2:
        for line1, line2 in zip(file1, file2):
            print(line1.strip(), line2.strip())

# Using a single `with` statement
with open("file1.txt", "r") as file1, open("file2.txt", "r") as file2:
    for line1, line2 in zip(file1, file2):
        print(line1.strip(), line2.strip())
```

### 3.2 Database Connection with a Lock
You might combine a database connection with a thread lock in a multithreaded environment.

#### Example:
```python
import sqlite3
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()

with lock, sqlite3.connect("example.db") as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)")
    conn.commit()
```

---

## 4. **Using `contextlib.ExitStack`**
`contextlib.ExitStack` allows you to dynamically manage multiple context managers, especially when the number of resources is not fixed.

### Syntax:
```python
from contextlib import ExitStack

with ExitStack() as stack:
    resource_1 = stack.enter_context(context_manager_1)
    resource_2 = stack.enter_context(context_manager_2)
    # Work with resource_1 and resource_2
```

### Example:
```python
from contextlib import ExitStack

files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"]

with ExitStack() as stack:
    open_files = [stack.enter_context(open(file, "r")) for file in files]
    for lines in zip(*open_files):
        print([line.strip() for line in lines])
```

**Why Use `ExitStack`?**
- Dynamically handle a variable number of resources.
- Simplifies cleanup logic.

---

## 5. **Order of Execution and Cleanup**
- **Setup:** Context managers are entered from left to right.
- **Cleanup:** Context managers are exited from right to left (LIFO order).

#### Example:
```python
class CustomContext:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"Entering {self.name}")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print(f"Exiting {self.name}")

with CustomContext("Context1") as c1, CustomContext("Context2") as c2:
    print("Inside nested context")
```
**Output:**
```
Entering Context1
Entering Context2
Inside nested context
Exiting Context2
Exiting Context1
```

---

## 6. **Error Handling in Nested Context Managers**
- If an exception occurs in one context, other contexts still execute their cleanup logic.

### Example:
```python
class CustomContext:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"Entering {self.name}")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print(f"Exiting {self.name}")
        return False  # Propagate exceptions

with CustomContext("Context1") as c1, CustomContext("Context2") as c2:
    raise ValueError("An error occurred")
```
**Output:**
```
Entering Context1
Entering Context2
Exiting Context2
Exiting Context1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: An error occurred
```

---

## 7. **Best Practices**
1. **Use a Single `with` Statement Where Possible:**
   - Improves readability and reduces indentation levels.

2. **Prefer `ExitStack` for Dynamic Contexts:**
   - Handles an unknown number of resources elegantly.

3. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully:**
   - Ensure all resources are cleaned up even when exceptions occur.

4. **Test Nested Logic Thoroughly:**
   - Verify that cleanup logic executes in the correct order.

---

## 8. **Common Pitfalls**
1. **Resource Leakage:**
   - Forgetting to close resources can cause resource leakage.

2. **Complexity in Dynamic Contexts:**
   - Avoid manually managing too many resources; use `ExitStack` for better control.

3. **Deep Nesting:**
   - Excessive nesting can make code harder to read. Consolidate with a single `with` statement where possible.

---

## 9. **Conclusion**
Nested context managers are essential for handling multiple resources efficiently and safely. Whether you are managing files, locks, or database connections, Python's `with` statement, along with tools like `contextlib.ExitStack`, ensures clean and concise resource management. By following best practices and understanding their behavior, you can avoid common pitfalls and write robust, maintainable code.
