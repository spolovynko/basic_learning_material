# Python Exceptions

## Introduction

Exceptions in Python are a mechanism for handling errors or unexpected conditions that occur during the execution of a program. Instead of causing a program to crash, exceptions provide a structured way to detect and manage errors gracefully. Python's exception-handling framework uses the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to allow developers to write robust and error-tolerant code.

This document elaborates on Python exceptions, their hierarchy, common built-in exceptions, and techniques for creating custom exceptions.

---

## What Are Exceptions?

An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. It is raised when an error occurs, either due to a programming mistake or an external issue (e.g., invalid input, file not found).

### Example of an Exception:

```python
x = 10 / 0  # Raises ZeroDivisionError
```

When the above code runs, Python raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because dividing by zero is undefined. The program stops execution unless the error is handled.

---

## Exception Handling in Python

Python provides a structured way to handle exceptions using the `try` and `except` blocks.

### Basic Exception Handling:

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
```

### Explanation:
1. The code inside the `try` block is executed.
2. If an exception occurs, the control moves to the `except` block.
3. The exception is handled, and the program continues executing.

### Using Multiple `except` Blocks:

You can handle multiple types of exceptions with separate `except` blocks.

```python
try:
    x = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("ValueError: Invalid input!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("ZeroDivisionError: Cannot divide by zero!")
```

### Using `else` and `finally`:

- **`else` Block**: Runs if no exception occurs in the `try` block.
- **`finally` Block**: Always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error occurred")
else:
    print("No errors occurred. Result:", x)
finally:
    print("Execution complete.")
```

---

## Python Exception Hierarchy

All exceptions in Python are derived from the base class `BaseException`. The `Exception` class is a direct subclass of `BaseException` and is the base class for all built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions.

### Simplified Hierarchy:

```
BaseException
|
+-- SystemExit
+-- KeyboardInterrupt
+-- GeneratorExit
+-- Exception
     |
     +-- ArithmeticError
     |    +-- ZeroDivisionError
     |    +-- OverflowError
     |    +-- FloatingPointError
     |
     +-- LookupError
          +-- IndexError
          +-- KeyError
```

### Common Built-In Exceptions:

1. **Arithmetic Errors**:
   - `ZeroDivisionError`: Division by zero.
   - `OverflowError`: Numeric result too large to represent.

2. **Lookup Errors**:
   - `IndexError`: Index out of range.
   - `KeyError`: Key not found in a dictionary.

3. **Type and Value Errors**:
   - `TypeError`: Invalid type of operation.
   - `ValueError`: Invalid value.

4. **IO Errors**:
   - `FileNotFoundError`: File does not exist.
   - `PermissionError`: No permission to access a file.

5. **Import Errors**:
   - `ImportError`: Failed to import a module.
   - `ModuleNotFoundError`: Module not found.

### Example:

```python
try:
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    print(my_list[5])  # Raises IndexError
except IndexError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

---

## Raising Exceptions

You can raise exceptions manually using the `raise` keyword.

### Example:

```python
x = -1
if x < 0:
    raise ValueError("Negative values are not allowed")
```

---

## Custom Exceptions

You can create custom exception classes by subclassing the `Exception` class. This allows you to define meaningful error types specific to your application.

### Example:

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        super().__init__(message)

try:
    raise CustomError("This is a custom error")
except CustomError as e:
    print("Caught custom exception:", e)
```

---

## Best Practices for Handling Exceptions

1. **Catch Specific Exceptions**:
   - Avoid using a bare `except` clause; always specify the exception type.

2. **Keep `try` Blocks Small**:
   - Only include the code that may raise an exception in the `try` block.

3. **Log Exceptions**:
   - Use logging to record exceptions for debugging and analysis.

4. **Avoid Silencing Exceptions**:
   - Do not use `except: pass`. Always handle exceptions properly.

5. **Re-raise Exceptions When Necessary**:
   - Use `raise` to propagate an exception if it cannot be handled meaningfully.

### Example:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    logging.error("An error occurred: %s", e)
    raise
```

---

## Conclusion

Python's exception-handling mechanism provides a robust framework for managing errors and ensuring program stability. By understanding the exception hierarchy, using structured handling with `try-except-else-finally`, and following best practices, developers can write resilient and maintainable code. Custom exceptions add further flexibility, allowing applications to define meaningful error types for specific scenarios.

# Python Error Handling

## Introduction

Error handling is a critical part of writing robust and reliable Python programs. Python provides a structured and intuitive framework to detect and handle errors at runtime using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. Proper error handling ensures that your program can gracefully manage unexpected situations, preventing crashes and improving user experience.

This document covers the essentials of Python error handling, advanced techniques, and best practices.

---

## The Basics of Python Error Handling

### The `try` and `except` Blocks

The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception. If an exception occurs, the `except` block is executed to handle it.

#### Example:

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

#### Explanation:
1. The `try` block executes the code `10 / 0`, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.
2. The `except` block catches the exception and prints an error message.

### Using Multiple `except` Blocks

You can handle multiple types of exceptions separately by specifying multiple `except` blocks.

#### Example:

```python
try:
    value = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid value!")
except TypeError:
    print("Type error encountered!")
```

### Using the `else` Block

The `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.

#### Example:

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print("Result:", result)
```

### The `finally` Block

The `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions.

#### Example:

```python
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
finally:
    if 'file' in locals() and not file.closed:
        file.close()
```

---

## Raising Exceptions

Python allows you to raise exceptions explicitly using the `raise` keyword. This is useful for validating input or enforcing constraints.

### Example:

```python
def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")
    print(f"Valid age: {age}")

try:
    validate_age(-1)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

---

## Catching Multiple Exceptions

You can catch multiple exceptions in a single `except` block using a tuple.

#### Example:

```python
try:
    x = int("abc")
    y = 1 / 0
except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
```

---

## Custom Exception Handling

Python allows you to define custom exceptions by subclassing the `Exception` class.

### Example:

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass

def risky_function():
    raise CustomError("Something went wrong!")

try:
    risky_function()
except CustomError as e:
    print("Caught custom exception:", e)
```

---

## Logging Exceptions

Instead of printing errors, you can log them for better monitoring and debugging.

### Example:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    logging.error("An error occurred: %s", e)
```

---

## Ignoring Exceptions

While generally not recommended, you can use a bare `except` block to silently ignore exceptions.

#### Example:

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except:
    pass  # Silently ignore the exception
```

### Caution:
- Silencing exceptions can make debugging difficult.
- Always handle exceptions explicitly whenever possible.

---

## Nested `try` Blocks

You can nest `try` blocks to handle different parts of code separately.

#### Example:

```python
try:
    try:
        result = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Inner block: Cannot divide by zero!")
        raise
except:
    print("Outer block: Exception propagated.")
```

---

## Best Practices for Python Error Handling

1. **Catch Specific Exceptions**:
   - Always specify the type of exceptions you want to handle.

2. **Avoid Bare `except`**:
   - Use specific exception classes instead of catching all exceptions.

3. **Keep `try` Blocks Small**:
   - Minimize the code inside the `try` block to reduce the risk of catching unintended exceptions.

4. **Use Logging**:
   - Log exceptions instead of printing them to make debugging easier.

5. **Use `finally` for Cleanup**:
   - Ensure resources like files or network connections are properly closed.

6. **Avoid Raising Generic Exceptions**:
   - Use meaningful exception types or custom exceptions for clarity.

7. **Document Exception Behavior**:
   - Clearly document which exceptions a function might raise.

---

## Conclusion

Error handling in Python is an essential skill for building robust applications. By using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks effectively, you can gracefully manage errors and maintain program stability. Understanding and following best practices ensures your code is both resilient and maintainable.

# Raising Exceptions in Python

## Introduction

Raising exceptions in Python allows developers to signal the occurrence of an error or unexpected condition explicitly. This mechanism is crucial for enforcing constraints, validating inputs, and ensuring proper error reporting in programs. The `raise` statement is used to trigger an exception, which can then be handled using `try` and `except` blocks.

This document elaborates on raising exceptions in Python, including syntax, use cases, and best practices.

---

## Basic Syntax for Raising Exceptions

The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception. It can be followed by an instance of an exception or the exception class itself.

### Raising a Built-in Exception

```python
x = -5
if x < 0:
    raise ValueError("x cannot be negative")
```

### Raising a Custom Exception

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass

raise CustomError("This is a custom exception")
```

### Raising an Exception Without Arguments

If an exception does not require additional information, you can raise it without arguments:

```python
raise RuntimeError
```

---

## Re-Raising Exceptions

You can re-raise an exception that was caught in an `except` block. This is useful for logging or modifying an error message before propagating it further.

### Example:

```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Caught exception:", e)
    raise  # Re-raise the exception
```

---

## Raising Exceptions with a Cause

Python allows you to explicitly associate one exception as the cause of another using the `from` keyword. This is useful for maintaining the exception chain and debugging.

### Example:

```python
try:
    raise ValueError("Invalid value")
except ValueError as e:
    raise RuntimeError("A runtime error occurred") from e
```

Output:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: Invalid value

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
RuntimeError: A runtime error occurred
```

---

## Custom Exceptions

Creating custom exceptions allows you to define specific error types for your application. Custom exceptions are subclasses of the `Exception` class.

### Example:

```python
class InvalidInputError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, input_value, message="Invalid input"):
        self.input_value = input_value
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

try:
    raise InvalidInputError("abc123", "Input must be numeric")
except InvalidInputError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e.message}. Invalid Value: {e.input_value}")
```

---

## Raising Multiple Exceptions

Python does not allow raising multiple exceptions simultaneously. However, you can create a custom exception that aggregates multiple errors using a container.

### Example:

```python
class AggregateError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, errors):
        self.errors = errors
        super().__init__("; ".join(str(e) for e in errors))

try:
    errors = []
    for value in ["abc", -5, 42]:
        if not isinstance(value, int):
            errors.append(TypeError(f"{value} is not an integer"))
        elif value < 0:
            errors.append(ValueError(f"{value} cannot be negative"))

    if errors:
        raise AggregateError(errors)
except AggregateError as e:
    print("Multiple errors occurred:", e)
```

---

## Raising Warnings as Exceptions

Python warnings can be raised as exceptions to enforce stricter error handling. This is useful for debugging or ensuring certain warnings are treated as critical issues.

### Example:

```python
import warnings

warnings.simplefilter("error")  # Convert warnings to exceptions

try:
    warnings.warn("This is a warning")
except Warning as e:
    print("Caught warning as exception:", e)
```

---

## Best Practices for Raising Exceptions

1. **Use Specific Exception Types**:
   - Raise exceptions that clearly describe the error, e.g., `ValueError` for invalid values, `TypeError` for type mismatches.

2. **Provide Clear Error Messages**:
   - Include meaningful and concise error messages to aid debugging.

3. **Use Custom Exceptions When Necessary**:
   - Define custom exceptions for application-specific error scenarios.

4. **Avoid Raising Generic Exceptions**:
   - Avoid using `Exception` or `BaseException` directly unless absolutely necessary.

5. **Maintain Exception Context**:
   - Use the `from` keyword to preserve exception context when re-raising exceptions.

6. **Log Exceptions**:
   - Log exceptions when raising or re-raising them to capture useful diagnostic information.

---

## Conclusion

Raising exceptions is a vital mechanism for enforcing constraints, validating inputs, and signaling errors in Python programs. By understanding how to raise built-in and custom exceptions, re-raise errors, and associate causes, developers can create robust and maintainable code. Following best practices ensures exceptions are meaningful, actionable, and helpful for debugging.

# Custom Exceptions in Python

## Introduction

Custom exceptions in Python allow developers to define their own error types, providing clarity and specificity when handling application-specific errors. While Python provides a rich set of built-in exceptions, creating custom exceptions can make your code more maintainable, descriptive, and tailored to the business logic of your application.

This document elaborates on how to define, raise, and use custom exceptions effectively.

---

## Why Use Custom Exceptions?

1. **Clarity**:
   - Custom exceptions clearly convey the intent and context of an error.

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - They allow for more granular exception handling, ensuring that specific issues are caught and addressed appropriately.

3. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Custom exceptions help isolate application-specific errors from generic exceptions, making the codebase easier to understand and debug.

---

## Creating a Custom Exception

Custom exceptions are created by subclassing the `Exception` class (or one of its derived classes).

### Example: Basic Custom Exception

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    """A custom exception class."""
    pass

try:
    raise CustomError("An error occurred")
except CustomError as e:
    print(f"Caught a custom exception: {e}")
```

Output:
```
Caught a custom exception: An error occurred
```

---

## Adding Attributes to Custom Exceptions

You can enhance custom exceptions by adding attributes to provide more context about the error.

### Example:

```python
class ValidationError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, field, message):
        self.field = field
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(f"{field}: {message}")

try:
    raise ValidationError("username", "Must be at least 5 characters long")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Error in field '{e.field}': {e.message}")
```

Output:
```
Error in field 'username': Must be at least 5 characters long
```

---

## Creating Exception Hierarchies

You can define a hierarchy of custom exceptions to represent different categories of errors in your application.

### Example:

```python
class ApplicationError(Exception):
    """Base class for application-specific exceptions."""
    pass

class DatabaseError(ApplicationError):
    """Exception raised for database-related errors."""
    pass

class NetworkError(ApplicationError):
    """Exception raised for network-related errors."""
    pass

try:
    raise DatabaseError("Failed to connect to the database")
except ApplicationError as e:
    print(f"Application error: {e}")
```

Output:
```
Application error: Failed to connect to the database
```

---

## Adding Methods to Custom Exceptions

Custom exceptions can include methods to perform additional actions or provide more information.

### Example:

```python
class InvalidInputError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, input_value):
        self.input_value = input_value
        super().__init__(f"Invalid input: {input_value}")

    def log_error(self):
        print(f"Logging error: {self.input_value}")

try:
    error = InvalidInputError("abc123")
    error.log_error()
    raise error
except InvalidInputError as e:
    print(e)
```

Output:
```
Logging error: abc123
Invalid input: abc123
```

---

## Using Custom Exceptions with `raise from`

The `raise from` syntax allows you to chain exceptions, preserving the context of the original error.

### Example:

```python
class DataProcessingError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    try:
        int("invalid")
    except ValueError as e:
        raise DataProcessingError("Failed to process data") from e
except DataProcessingError as e:
    print(e)
    print("Original exception:", e.__cause__)
```

Output:
```
Failed to process data
Original exception: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'invalid'
```

---

## Best Practices for Custom Exceptions

1. **Inherit from `Exception`**:
   - Always subclass `Exception` (or one of its derived classes).

2. **Use Descriptive Names**:
   - The exception name should reflect the nature of the error (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`).

3. **Provide Context**:
   - Include attributes or methods that provide additional context about the error.

4. **Organize Exceptions Hierarchically**:
   - Use a base class for related exceptions and derive specific exceptions from it.

5. **Document Custom Exceptions**:
   - Include docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of the exception.

6. **Preserve Exception Context**:
   - Use `raise from` to chain exceptions when appropriate.

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Validation Errors

```python
class ValidationError(Exception):
    pass

def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise ValidationError("Age cannot be negative")

try:
    validate_age(-1)
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
```

### 2. File Processing Errors

```python
class FileProcessingError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    with open("nonexistent.txt", "r") as file:
        data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    raise FileProcessingError("Failed to process file") from e
```

### 3. API Errors

```python
class APIError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, status_code, message):
        self.status_code = status_code
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(f"API Error {status_code}: {message}")

try:
    response_code = 500
    if response_code != 200:
        raise APIError(response_code, "Internal Server Error")
except APIError as e:
    print(e)
```

---

## Conclusion

Custom exceptions in Python allow developers to define meaningful, application-specific error types. By creating custom exception hierarchies, adding attributes, and following best practices, you can make your error handling more robust and maintainable. Custom exceptions improve clarity, debugging, and the overall structure of your code.
