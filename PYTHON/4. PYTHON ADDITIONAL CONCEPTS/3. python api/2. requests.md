# Using the `requests` Library in Python

The `requests` library is a powerful and user-friendly HTTP client for Python. It simplifies making HTTP requests, handling responses, and interacting with web services. Below are common use cases and techniques for using `requests` effectively.

## Installation
Before using `requests`, install it via pip:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## 1. Sending a Simple GET Request
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
print(response.text)  # Print response content
```

## 2. Reading the Response
```python
print(response.status_code)  # HTTP status code
print(response.headers)      # Response headers
print(response.json())       # Parse JSON response (if applicable)
```

## 3. Passing URL Parameters
```python
params = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', params=params)
print(response.url)  # Check the final URL
```

## 4. Custom Headers
```python
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN', 'User-Agent': 'my-app'}
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', headers=headers)
```

## 5. Changing Request Method (POST, PUT, DELETE)
```python
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/data', data={'key': 'value'})
response = requests.put('https://api.example.com/data/1', data={'key': 'updated_value'})
response = requests.delete('https://api.example.com/data/1')
```

## 6. Sending JSON Data in a Request
```python
import json

data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/users', json=data)
```

## 7. Sending Form Data
```python
data = {'username': 'john', 'password': 'securepassword'}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/login', data=data)
```

## 8. Sending Files
```python
files = {'file': open('document.txt', 'rb')}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/upload', files=files)
```

## 9. Sending an Image
```python
files = {'image': open('image.jpg', 'rb')}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/upload', files=files)
```

## 10. Handling Exceptions
```python
try:
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', timeout=5)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx and 5xx)
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print('The request timed out')
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f'An error occurred: {e}')
```

## 11. Setting a Timeout
```python
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', timeout=10)  # Timeout in seconds
```

## 12. HTTP Basic Authentication
```python
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/secure', auth=HTTPBasicAuth('user', 'pass'))
```

# What is a Request?

## 1. Introduction
A **request** is a fundamental concept in web communication, representing a message sent from a client to a server, typically over the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). Requests are used to fetch resources, submit data, and interact with web applications.

## 2. Components of a Request
An HTTP request consists of several key components:

### 2.1 Client and Server
- **Client**: The entity making the request, such as a web browser, mobile app, or API consumer.
- **Server**: The system receiving and processing the request, responding with the appropriate data or action.

### 2.2 URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
The **URL** specifies the address of the resource being requested. It consists of several parts:
- **Protocol** (e.g., `https://`)
- **Domain** (e.g., `example.com`)
- **Path** (e.g., `/api/data`)
- **Query Parameters** (e.g., `?id=123`)

### 2.3 Request Line
The request line contains three essential elements:
- **HTTP Method**: Specifies the action to be performed (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **URL**: Identifies the resource being requested.
- **HTTP Version**: Defines the version of the HTTP protocol being used.

Example:
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
```

### 2.4 Headers
Headers provide metadata about the request and include:
- `User-Agent`: Identifies the client making the request.
- `Content-Type`: Specifies the format of the request body (e.g., JSON, XML).
- `Authorization`: Contains credentials for authentication.

Example:
```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer token123
```

### 2.5 Request Body (Optional)
The request body carries data for methods like POST and PUT. It is typically formatted as JSON, XML, or form-encoded data.

Example JSON body:
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

## 3. Types of Requests
Requests can be categorized based on their method:

- **GET**: Requests data from a server without modifying it.
- **POST**: Sends data to the server to create a resource.
- **PUT**: Updates an existing resource on the server.
- **DELETE**: Removes a resource from the server.
- **HEAD**: Retrieves headers from a resource without the response body.
- **OPTIONS**: Requests available communication options for a resource.

## 4. Message Returned by the Server
After receiving a request, the server processes it and sends back an HTTP response. This response consists of:
1. **Status Code** – Indicates the outcome of the request (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
2. **Headers** – Contain metadata about the response (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`).
3. **Body** (Optional) – Contains the requested data, often in JSON, HTML, or XML format.

Example response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Buy groceries",
  "completed": false
}
```

## 5. Example HTTP Request in Python
Using the `requests` library in Python, an HTTP request can be made as follows:
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
print(response.json())
```
This sends a GET request and prints the retrieved data.

## 6. Conclusion
Requests are essential in web interactions, enabling communication between clients and servers. Understanding request components, the role of clients and servers, URL structure, and response messages is crucial for web development, API consumption, and networking.

# Request and Response Data

## 1. Introduction
In web communication, **requests** are used to send data to a server, and **responses** are used to receive data from the server. Different types of data can be transmitted using query parameters, form data, JSON, files, and XML.

## 2. Request Data
### 2.1 URL Parameters
URL parameters (also called **query parameters**) are key-value pairs appended to a URL. They are used to send data in a GET request.

Example:
```
GET https://api.example.com/users?name=john&age=30
```
Python example:
```python
import requests
params = {"name": "john", "age": 30}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users", params=params)
print(response.url)  # Outputs: https://api.example.com/users?name=john&age=30
```

### 2.2 Form Data
Form data is used to send key-value pairs in an encoded format, typically when submitting forms.

Example POST request:
```python
import requests
form_data = {"username": "john_doe", "password": "securepass"}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/login", data=form_data)
print(response.text)
```

### 2.3 JSON Data
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is widely used to send structured data to APIs.

Example POST request with JSON:
```python
import requests
json_data = {"username": "john_doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/users", json=json_data)
print(response.json())
```

### 2.4 Sending and Receiving Files
Files can be sent to a server using the `files` parameter.

Example file upload:
```python
import requests
files = {"file": open("document.pdf", "rb")}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/upload", files=files)
print(response.text)
```

Example file download:
```python
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/download/sample.pdf")
with open("sample.pdf", "wb") as file:
    file.write(response.content)
```

### 2.5 XML Data
Some APIs accept XML format instead of JSON.

Example XML request:
```python
import requests
xml_data = """
<data>
    <username>john_doe</username>
    <email>john@example.com</email>
</data>
"""
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/xml"}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/users", data=xml_data, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

## 3. Response Data
### 3.1 Status Codes
Servers respond with status codes indicating the success or failure of a request:
- `200 OK`: Success
- `201 Created`: Resource created
- `400 Bad Request`: Client error
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required
- `404 Not Found`: Resource does not exist
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

### 3.2 Response Headers
Response headers provide metadata about the returned content.
```python
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
print(response.headers["Content-Type"])  # Example: application/json
```

### 3.3 Handling JSON Responses
```python
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

### 3.4 Handling XML Responses
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data.xml")
root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
for child in root:
    print(child.tag, child.text)
```

## 4. Conclusion
Understanding how to send and receive different types of data—such as URL parameters, form data, JSON, files, and XML—is essential for working with APIs and web services. Proper handling of responses ensures seamless communication between clients and servers.

# Request Components

## 1. Introduction
A **request** in web communication consists of multiple components that define how data is sent to a server. Understanding these components is crucial for working with APIs and web services. The main components of a request include HTTP methods, request data, headers, and authentication mechanisms.

## 2. Request Methods
HTTP methods define the action a request performs on a resource. The most common methods include:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server without modifying it.
- **POST**: Send data to a server to create a new resource.
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.
- **HEAD**: Retrieve headers without the response body.
- **OPTIONS**: Request available communication options for a resource.
- **PATCH**: Apply partial modifications to a resource.

Example:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
print(response.json())
```

## 3. Request Data
The request body contains data that needs to be sent to the server. It can be in various formats:

### 3.1 Query Parameters
Data appended to the URL in a GET request.
Example:
```
GET https://api.example.com/users?name=john&age=30
```
Python example:
```python
params = {"name": "john", "age": 30}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users", params=params)
```

### 3.2 Form Data
Used in HTML form submissions and API requests.
```python
form_data = {"username": "john_doe", "password": "securepass"}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/login", data=form_data)
```

### 3.3 JSON Data
A structured format commonly used in APIs.
```python
json_data = {"username": "john_doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/users", json=json_data)
```

### 3.4 File Uploads
Used to send files to a server.
```python
files = {"file": open("document.pdf", "rb")}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/upload", files=files)
```

## 4. Headers
Headers provide metadata about the request and help configure it properly.

### Common Headers:
- `User-Agent`: Identifies the client making the request.
- `Content-Type`: Specifies the format of the request body (e.g., `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).
- `Authorization`: Contains credentials for authentication.
- `Accept`: Defines the expected response format.

Example:
```python
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data", headers=headers)
```

## 5. Authentication
Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access certain resources. Common authentication mechanisms include:

### 5.1 API Keys
A simple token used to authenticate requests.
```python
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key"}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data", headers=headers)
```

### 5.2 Basic Authentication
Uses a username and password encoded in the request.
```python
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/protected", auth=("user", "pass"))
```

### 5.3 OAuth
A more secure method used for API authentication.
```python
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_oauth_token"}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/user", headers=headers)
```

## 6. Conclusion
Understanding request components such as methods, data formats, headers, and authentication mechanisms is essential for working with APIs. Properly structuring requests ensures smooth communication between clients and servers.

# Response Components

## 1. Introduction
When a server receives a request, it processes it and returns an **HTTP response** to the client. The response consists of multiple components, including the **status code**, **headers**, and **response body (data)**. Understanding these components helps developers interact efficiently with web APIs and troubleshoot issues.

## 2. Status Code
A **status code** is a three-digit number that indicates the outcome of the request. It provides information on whether the request was successful, failed, or requires further action.

### 2.1 Common HTTP Status Codes

#### **2xx: Success**
- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.

#### **3xx: Redirection**
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved.
- **302 Found**: The requested resource is temporarily available at a different location.
- **304 Not Modified**: The requested resource has not changed since the last request.

#### **4xx: Client Errors**
- **400 Bad Request**: The request is malformed or contains invalid data.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required.
- **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have permission to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.

#### **5xx: Server Errors**
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A general error occurred on the server.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unavailable.

Example of retrieving a status code in Python:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
print(response.status_code)  # Outputs: 200
```

## 3. Response Headers
Response headers provide metadata about the server and the requested resource. They contain information such as content type, cache control, and authentication details.

### 3.1 Common Response Headers
- **Content-Type**: Specifies the media type of the response body (e.g., `application/json`, `text/html`).
- **Content-Length**: Indicates the size of the response body in bytes.
- **Cache-Control**: Determines how long the response can be cached.
- **Set-Cookie**: Stores session-related information for authentication.

Example of retrieving headers in Python:
```python
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
print(response.headers["Content-Type"])  # Outputs: application/json
```

## 4. Response Body (Data)
The **response body** contains the actual data sent back from the server. It can be in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or plain text.

### 4.1 JSON Response
Most modern APIs return data in JSON format.
```python
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
data = response.json()
print(data)
```
Example JSON response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### 4.2 XML Response
Some APIs return data in XML format.
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data.xml")
root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
for child in root:
    print(child.tag, child.text)
```
Example XML response:
```xml
<user>
    <id>1</id>
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <email>john@example.com</email>
</user>
```

### 4.3 File Download
Some responses contain file data such as PDFs or images.
```python
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/download/sample.pdf")
with open("sample.pdf", "wb") as file:
    file.write(response.content)
```

## 5. Conclusion
HTTP responses contain essential information, including **status codes**, **headers**, and **data formats** like JSON, XML, or files. Understanding these components helps developers efficiently work with web APIs, troubleshoot issues, and optimize web applications.

# HTTP Status Codes

## 1. Introduction
HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's request. These codes indicate the outcome of the request, whether it was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action. Status codes are categorized into five groups based on their first digit.

## 2. Categories of HTTP Status Codes

### 2.1 **1xx: Informational Responses**
These codes indicate that the server has received the request and is still processing it.

- **100 Continue** – The initial part of the request has been received, and the client should continue.
- **101 Switching Protocols** – The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.
- **102 Processing** – The server has received the request but is taking longer to process it.
- **103 Early Hints** – The server sends preliminary headers before the final response.

### 2.2 **2xx: Success Responses**
These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed.

- **200 OK** – The request was successful, and the response contains the requested data.
- **201 Created** – The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
- **202 Accepted** – The request has been accepted for processing but is not yet completed.
- **204 No Content** – The request was successful, but there is no response body.
- **206 Partial Content** – The server is returning only part of the resource, usually in response to a range request.

### 2.3 **3xx: Redirection Responses**
These codes indicate that further action is required to complete the request.

- **301 Moved Permanently** – The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found** – The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified** – The resource has not changed since the last request, reducing bandwidth usage.
- **307 Temporary Redirect** – Similar to 302 but the request method must remain the same.
- **308 Permanent Redirect** – Similar to 301 but retains the original request method.

### 2.4 **4xx: Client Errors**
These codes indicate an error caused by the client’s request.

- **400 Bad Request** – The server cannot process the request due to client-side errors (e.g., malformed syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized** – Authentication is required for access.
- **403 Forbidden** – The client does not have permission to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found** – The requested resource does not exist on the server.
- **405 Method Not Allowed** – The requested HTTP method is not supported for the resource.
- **408 Request Timeout** – The server timed out waiting for the client’s request.
- **429 Too Many Requests** – The client has sent too many requests in a short time (rate-limiting).

### 2.5 **5xx: Server Errors**
These codes indicate that the server failed to process the request due to an internal error.

- **500 Internal Server Error** – A general server error occurred.
- **501 Not Implemented** – The server does not support the requested method.
- **502 Bad Gateway** – The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable** – The server is temporarily unavailable, often due to maintenance or overload.
- **504 Gateway Timeout** – The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.
- **505 HTTP Version Not Supported** – The server does not support the HTTP version used in the request.

## 3. Conclusion
Understanding HTTP status codes is essential for debugging web applications and APIs. They help developers identify whether a request was successful, needs modification, or encountered an error on the client or server side. Proper handling of these status codes ensures efficient and reliable communication between clients and servers.
